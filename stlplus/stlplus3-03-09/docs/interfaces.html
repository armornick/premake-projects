<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>It is increasingly the case that you use generic algorithms in programming
rather than reinvent the wheel by writing the algorithms yourself. Similarly,
generic data structures should be used rather than reinventing data structures
yourself.</p>

<p>The generic algorithm or data structure will require the object
supplied by you to provide certain methods with a certain set of parameters in
order to work.</p>

<p>So, the question is, if you are defining a generic algorithm or data
structure, how do you specify the methods that the
user must provide?</p>

<p>Clearly this could be done by writing comments all over the place or
writing documentation that specifies the methods and their parameters. Of
course, the documentation of the generic software should indeed contain such
information. However, a better solution is one which is expressed in C++ so
that the interface can be seen in a header file and which enables a compiler
to do some consistency checking.</p>

<p>In Java there is a built-in concept called an interface that provides this
functionality. What I have done therefore is to mimic the Java interface in
C++.</p>


<h2 id="classes">Interface Classes</h2>

<p>I define a C++ interface to be a class with one or more methods, some or
all of which are abstract. The user indicates that they are providing the
interface by making their class a derivative of the interface class.</p>

<p>An abstract method is one which has "<code>= 0</code>" placed after its
declaration. This seems odd at first because it reads like an initial value.
It makes more sense if you see it as meaning that the method has a null
address.</p>

<p>A class is abstract if one or more of its methods is abstract.</p>

<p>It is illegal to create an object of an abstract class. You can only use it
as a baseclass to a derivation that overloads all of the abstract methods.
Only when all the abstract methods are overloaded by non-abstract methods does
the derived class itself become non-abstract.</p>

<p>For example, the following class is abstract:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
class printable
{
public:
  void print(std::ostream&amp;) const = 0;
};
</pre>

<p>This class is abstract because the print method is abstract. Such a class
would define an interface to a printable object - so its name reflects its
usage. Interface classes tend to have adjectives as names. The methods as
usual in C++ are verbs.</p>

<p>In this case, the class has only one method and it is abstract. This is a
pure interface class. However, sometimes it is convenient to provide other
methods in the interface class which implement composite operations by
calling the abstract methods. This is an impure interface. For example:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
class printable
{
public:
  void print(std::ostream&amp;) const = 0;
  void print_indented(std::ostream&amp;, unsigned indent);
};
</pre>

<p>In this case, the interface is saying that you must provide an overload of
the abstract method <code>print</code>. Having done so, you will be able to
call <code>print_indented</code> which has been defined in terms of the
abstract <code>print</code> function. The point is that to implement the
interface you only need to provide the abstract methods and having done so you
can then use the non-abstract methods provided by the interface.</p>

<p>When you derive from an interface class, the rules of C++ require you to
provide non-abstract overloadings of all the abstract methods defined in the
interface. It is illegal in C++ to create an object of an abstract class and
your class will only be non-abstract if <em>all</em> of the abstract functions
have been overloaded correctly. Therefore the compiler can confirm that all
the methods required by the interface have been provided. If you have missed
out a method or mis-defined it, there will still be at least one abstract
method inherited from the interface class and therefore your class will be
abstract too. A compiler error will be produced when you try to create an
object of the class.</p>

<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>

<p>The above printable interface is an artificial example and you will not
find it in the STLplus library.</p>

<h3>The Persistent Interface</h3>

<p>This is an example taken from the STLplus library. I have defined a
<code>persistent</code> interface for use with polymorphic types. It is only used for
polymorphic types for which the best way of proving data persistence is
through virtual methods.</p>

<p>The <code>persistent</code> interface is defined by the following class:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
namespace stlplus
{

  class persistent
  {
  public:
    virtual void dump(dump_context&amp;) const throw(persistent_dump_failed) = 0;
    virtual void restore(restore_context&amp;) throw(persistent_restore_failed) = 0;
    virtual persistent* clone(void) const = 0;
  };

}
</pre>

<p>Using the trivial class from the previous section; to make that class
persistent, you derive it from the <code>persistent</code> interface:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
class base<strong> : public persistent</strong>
{
  int m_value;
public:
  base(int value = 0) : m_value(value) {}
  virtual ~base(void) {}

  virtual int value (void) const {return m_value;}
  virtual void set(int value = 0) {m_value = value;}

  <strong>void dump(dump_context&amp; context) const {stlplus::dump_int(context,m_value);}</strong>
  <strong>void restore(restore_context&amp; context) {stlplus::restore_int(context,m_value);}</strong>
  <strong>persistent* clone(void) const {return new base(*this);}</strong>
};
</pre>

<p>You will need to read the 
<a href="persistence.html">documentation on persistence</a> to find out all the
details of how this interface is used to provide data persistence - this
document is only concerned with the meaning of the interface class and the
requirements that it defines.</p>
