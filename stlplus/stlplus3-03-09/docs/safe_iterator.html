<h2 id="philosophy">Philosophy</h2>

<p>Iterators in the STL are badly designed - there are several major
pitfalls with using them as a result of their design. However, I
wanted STLplus to feel like the STL to make it easier to use, so felt
I should use the iterator concept despite the problems associated with
them. Some of the STLplus components therefore also use iterators.</p>

<p> The problems with STL iterators are:</p>

<ul>

<li>Unassigned iterators are poorly defined and can not only point to
  random memory but have no checking to stop them from being
  dereferenced.</li>

<li>End iterators conceptually point to a location one element after
the end of the data structure. The STL classes actually have a piece
of unconstructed memory to represent the end - which looks like real
memory that's been corrupted. This is extraordinarily bad
practice. </li>

<li>Iterators don't know which container created them. For
example, in the STL, creating an iterator from one list and then
accidentally using it in a second list can potentially corrupt the
list.</li>

<li>When an object held by a container is destroyed, iterators can
  still point to the deallocated memory and there's nothing to stop
  them from being dereferenced.</li>

</ul>


<h2 id="errors">Errors Caught by the Safe Iterator</h2>

<p>The STLplus safe iterators were designed to solve the problems with
  the STL iterators. The following solutions have been implemented:</p>

<ul>

<li>Unassigned iterators initialise to a "null" iterator. It is
illegal to try to dereference a null iterator - the safe_iterator
class throws a null_dereference exception.</li>

<li>The end iterator concept is a property of the iterator itself and
there is no unconstructed memory. It is illegal to dereference the end
iterator - the safe_iterator class will throw an end_dereference
exception.</li>

<li>Iterators must be used with the container that created them. The
safe iterator knows which object it belongs to and, if used with the
wrong object, will throw the wrong_object exception.</li>

<li>When an object held by a container is destroyed, all iterators
pointing to the object are set to the end iterator. This prevents
iterators being used to access deallocated memory.</li>

</ul>

<h2 id="classes">Classes Using the Safe Iterator</h2>

<p>The following STLplus classes use safe iterators, all of them based on the safe_iterator class:</p>

<ul>
<li class="external"><a href="digraph.html">digraph</a></li>
<li class="external"><a href="ntree.html">ntree</a></li>
<li class="external"><a href="hash.html">hash</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="interface">Interface</h2>

<p>Here is the user interface to the safe_iterator class:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
template&lt;typename O, typename N&gt;
class stlplus::safe_iterator
{
public:
  // construct a null iterator
  safe_iterator(void) throw();

  // construct a valid iterator from the owner node's master iterator
  safe_iterator(const master_iterator&lt;O,N&gt;&amp;) throw();

  // comparison - used to create comparison operators for putting
  // iterators into maps and hashes
  bool equal(const safe_iterator&lt;O,N&gt;&amp; right) const throw();
  int compare(const safe_iterator&lt;O,N&gt;&amp; right) const throw();

  // dereference
  N&amp; operator*(void) const throw(null_dereference,end_dereference);
  N* operator-&gt;(void) const throw(null_dereference,end_dereference);

  // a null iterator is one that has not been initialised with a value yet
  // i.e. you just declared it but didn't assign to it
  bool null(void) const throw();

  // an end iterator is one that points to the end element of the list of nodes
  // in STL conventions this is one past the last valid element and must not be dereferenced
  bool end(void) const throw();

  // a valid iterator is one that can be dereferenced
  // i.e. non-null and non-end
  bool valid(void) const throw();

  // called by the owner class to check the rules
  void assert_valid(const O* owner) const throw(wrong_object,null_dereference,end_dereference);
};
</pre>

<p>The void constructor ensures that an unassigned iterator is
classified as a null iterator.</p>

<p>The second iterator is used internally by the container object to
create a valid iterator.</p>

<p>Built-in comparison methods allow for comparison operators to be
  written for any iterator derived from safe_iterator, for example to
  test for the end condition in a for loop or any other
  conditional. They also allow iterators to be added to sets (the &lt;
  operator) and hashes (the == operator).</p>

<p>The dereference operators are only legal on valid iterators - any
attempt to dereference a null or end iterator will throw an
exception.</p>

<p>The methods null(), end() and valid() allow the programmer to test
the validity of an iterator before dereferencing it.</p>

<p>The assert_valid method is called by the owning container to check
that the iterator belongs to it before using it. If not, it will throw
the wrong_object exception. Also, if the owner needs to dereference
the iterator, it will check whether it is valid and if not, throw
either the null_dereference or end_dereference exception.</p>
