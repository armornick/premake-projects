<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>This component is an STL-like template class which implements a tree data structure. I called it
an ntree (short for n-ary tree) years ago due to a misunderstanding - this is in fact a <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(graph_theory)">rooted ordered tree</a>. However, the name
has stuck because I don't want to break existing code that uses it.</p>


<h2 id="instantiation">Instantiation</h2>

<p>The ntree template takes a single type as its template argument:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
template&lt;typename T&gt; class ntree
</pre>

<p>This type is the type to be stored on each node of the tree structure. For
example, a variable representing a tree of strings can be created like
this:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
ntree&lt;string&gt; strings;
</pre>


<h2 id="basics">Basics - Nodes and Iterators</h2>

<p>An ntree is a tree of nodes, each one containing the user type (represented
by T in the template declaration). Each node also contains hidden field which
you don't need to know about but which implement the tree structure.</p>

<p>Like other STL containers, the ntree uses an iterator as a pseudo-pointer
or handle to a node. These iterators act like pointers when they are
dereferenced and give access to the user data (type T) associated with that
node.</p>

<p>There are two basic iterator types defined in ntree:</p>

<ul>
<li>iterator - a node iterator</li>
<li>const_iterator - a node iterator for const ntrees</li>
</ul>

<p>These names follow the normal conventions for STL classes. An iterator is
used to act on a non-const ntree and can modify it, whereas the const_iterator
act on a const ntree and can only perform read-only operations on it.</p>

<p>However, the iterator concept starts to break down a bit here and the
ntree iterator does not allow increment or decrement operations to step
through the tree. However, you should see the prefix_iterator and
postfix_iterator defined in the next section.</p>

<p>Iterators act very much like STL list iterators in that changing an ntree
does not invalidate iterators except for those pointing to nodes that have
been erased from the tree.</p>

<p>Since there are no increment or decrement operations on an iterator, other
methods are provided to allow tree traversal. Here's the traversal
functions for iterators:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
iterator ntree::root(void);
unsigned ntree::children(iterator);
iterator ntree::child(iterator, unsigned child);
iterator ntree::parent(iterator);
</pre>

<p>Note: These methods are members of the ntree class, not the iterator class.</p>

<p>Thus, you can traverse a tree by first getting the root node, then
iterating through its child nodes. Alternatively, you can walk up the tree
from a node to the root by following the parent pointers. Children are
accessed by a numeric offset starting at 0. Thus a node with 4 children will
have offsets of 0..3 to access them.</p>

<p>There's an identical set of these functions acting on const_iterator of
course.</p>

<p>STLplus iterators are slightly different to STL iterators in that they know which container they
belong to. When an iterator is first declared, but not assigned to, it is known as a <em>null</em>
iterator. Then, when it is assigned to so that it points to a node in the tree, it is known as a
<em>valid</em> iterator. If the iterator is made to point off the edge of the tree - for example the
parent of the root node, then it becomes an <em>end</em> iterator.</p>

<p>This concept is similar to STL iterators like the list iterator, where an iterator that walks off
the end of the list becomes an end iterator. However, the STL has no concept of a null iterator and
therefore no direct equivalent of a valid iterator.</p>

<p>The iterator has a set of functions for testing these
conditions:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
bool iterator::null(void) const;
bool iterator::end(void) const;
bool iterator::valid(void) const;
</pre>

<p>Note that these functions are members of the iterator class, not the ntree
class.</p>

<p>Exactly one of these conditions will always be true, since the iterator must be one of null, end
or valid.</p>

<p>Only a valid iterator can be dereferenced to access the node type T pointed to by the iterator.
Any attempt to dereference an end or null iterator will result in an exception being thrown. See the
section below on <a href="#exceptions">Exceptions</a> to see which.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
ntree&lt;string&gt; data;
...
ntree&lt;string&gt;::iterator i = data.root();
if (i.valid())
{
  for (unsigned j = 0; j &lt; data.children(i); j++)
    ...
}
</pre>

<p>When dereferencing an iterator, you access the user data type T. In the
above examples, this is type std::string. A non-const iterator gives access to
a reference to this type which can be assigned to as well as read. Thus you
can change the contents of a node. However, a const_iterator gives access to a
const reference which cannot be assigned to but can be read. This is how all
STL-like iterators work.</p>


<h2 id="manipulating">Manipulating Trees</h2>

<p>When you declare an ntree, the result is an empty tree - namely a tree with
a null root. Typically, the root has to be handled slightly
differently to other nodes, since it does not have a parent node. This
functionality is provided by the insert(T) function, where T is the user
data type as usual:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
iterator ntree::insert(const T&amp;);
</pre>

<p>This clears any previous tree contents, creates a root node and assigns the
data in type T to this node. It returns an iterator to the root node.</p>

<p>Once there is a root node, other nodes are added by specifying the parent
node to add it to and the index to add it into the child pointers. For
example, inserting at position 0 prepends it to the list of child nodes,
whilst inserting at the position indicated by the current number of children
will append it to the list. For example, inserting at position 4 for a node
with 4 children (offsets 0..3 remember) will append it to the list. For
convenience there is an alternative insert function to make this particular action
simpler. Thus, there are two functions for adding a non-root node:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
iterator ntree::insert(iterator parent, unsigned offset, const T&amp; node_data);
iterator ntree::insert(iterator parent, const T&amp; node_data);
</pre>

<p>It is also possible to add a <em>copy</em> of another tree to the
root or to a node, thus adding a whole subtree in one go:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
iterator ntree::insert(const ntree&lt;T&gt;&amp;);
iterator ntree::insert(iterator, unsigned, const ntree&lt;T&gt;&amp;);
iterator ntree::insert(iterator, const ntree&lt;T&gt;&amp;);
</pre>

<p>All of these methods copy the argument into the current tree. The
  first method erases the current tree and then copies the argument tree into
  the root. The second copies the tree to make it the designated child
  of the node. The third is the same as the second but appends it to
  the set of children.</p>

<p>Another way of adding a copy of another tree as the root of this tree is done by simple
assignment of one tree to another - assignment does a copy.</p>

<p>If you want to move one tree into another tree without copying it,
  use the move methods. Once again, there are three with similar
  functionality to the insert functions:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
iterator ntree::move(ntree&lt;T&gt;&amp;);
iterator ntree::move(iterator, unsigned, ntree&lt;T&gt;&amp;);
iterator ntree::move(iterator, ntree&lt;T&gt;&amp;);
</pre>

<p>Note that the argument is non-const because it's contents are
  removed leaving it empty after the move.</p>

<p>The move operations also move all iterators to nodes in the tree
  being moved so that they can continue to be used even though the
  nodes now belong to a different tree.</p>

<p>There are three erase functions: one to erase the whole tree, one to erase
a node and its children and one to erase a single child of a node:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
void ntree::erase(void);
void ntree::erase(iterator);
void ntree::erase(iterator, unsigned);
</pre>

<p>The difference between the last two maybe needs more explanation. The first
form erases the node pointed to by the iterator. It removes the node from its
parent's child list and deletes all of its children. The second form is
effectively the same, but seen from the point of view of the parent node. In
this case, a single child node indicated by the unsigned offset is removed
from the node's child list and deleted. In all cases the whole subtree below
the deleted node is also deleted.</p>

<p>To copy a subtree of an ntree, use the subtree functions:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
ntree&lt;T&gt; ntree::subtree(void);
ntree&lt;T&gt; ntree::subtree(iterator);
ntree&lt;T&gt; ntree::subtree(iterator, unsigned);
</pre>

<p>The first function makes a subtree out of the whole tree, effectively
making an exact copy of the whole tree. The second form copies the tree
starting from the node pointed to by the iterator. Thus the resulting tree
will have a copy of this node as its root. The third form copies the tree one
level down from this, copying from the designated child of the pointed-to
node.</p>

<p>The final set of functions allow parts of an ntree to be cut off and made
into new trees:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
ntree&lt;T&gt; ntree::cut(void);
ntree&lt;T&gt; ntree::cut(iterator);
ntree&lt;T&gt; ntree::cut(iterator, unsigned);
</pre>

<p>These are very similar to the subtree functions except that they are
destructive. They remove part or all of the source tree. The first cuts the
whole tree leaving it empty and creating a new tree which contains all of the
old tree. The second cuts out the designated node and its subtree, removing it
from its parent node's child list. The last removes a child and makes a new
tree out of it.</p>


<h2 id="traversal">Traversal Iterators</h2>

<p>Earlier it was pointed out that ntree iterators are only used to point to
nodes, they cannot be used to iterate through the tree (so making the name
iterator a bit inappropriate, but I did that for consistency with other data
structures). There are in fact two pairs of iterators which can be used to
traverse an ntree. These are the prefix_iterator and the postfix_iterator. As
usual with STL-like containers, they occur in non-const and const form, giving
four iterators in all:</p>

<ul>
<li>prefix_iterator - traverses the tree in prefix order - i.e. visits each
node before any of its children</li>
<li>const_prefix_iterator - const version of the above</li>
<li>postfix_iterator - traverses the tree in postfix order - i.e. visits each
node after all of its children</li>
<li>const_postfix_iterator - const version of the above</li>
</ul>

<p>These iterators are used just like other STL-like iterators, except bear in
mind that only forward traversals are possible, by which I mean that only the
++ operator is provided.</p>

<p>The iteration is started by prefix_begin() for prefix iterators and
postfix_begin() for postfix iterators. Similarly the end of iteration is
tested by comparing with prefix_end() or postfix_end(). Specifically, the
functions are:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
const_prefix_iterator ntree::prefix_begin(void) const;
prefix_iterator ntree::prefix_begin(void);
const_prefix_iterator ntree::prefix_end(void) const;
prefix_iterator ntree::prefix_end(void);

const_postfix_iterator ntree::postfix_begin(void) const;
postfix_iterator ntree::postfix_begin(void);
const_postfix_iterator ntree::postfix_end(void) const;
postfix_iterator ntree::postfix_end(void);
</pre>

<p>An example:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
ntree&lt;string&gt; data;
...
for (ntree&lt;string&gt;::prefix_iterator i = data.prefix_begin(); i != data.prefix_end(); i++)
{
  ...
}
</pre>

<p>These traversal iterators allow access to the node data just as the simple
iterator does - by dereferencing the iterator. The iterators also have the tests for end, null and
valid iterators, and it is only legal to dereference a valid iterator.</p>

<p>However, you cannot use the traversal iterators to access other information from the ntree class
such as the parent node or the child nodes, since the functions providing this information only take
simple iterators. For this reason, all the traversal iterators have a member function called
simplify(). For example, a prefix_iterator simplifies to an iterator and a const_postfix_iterator
simplifies to a const_iterator. The full set of simplify functions are:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
iterator prefix_iterator::simplify(void) const;
const_iterator const_prefix_iterator::simplify(void) const;
iterator postfix_iterator::simplify(void) const;
const_iterator const_postfix_iterator::simplify(void) const;
</pre>

<p>Once the simple iterator has been extracted, it <em>can</em> be used to access other information
from the ntree class.</p>


<h2 id="exceptions">Exceptions Thrown by Ntree</h2>

<p>When errors are discovered within an ntree, it resorts to throwing an
exception to indicate that error.</p>

<p>There are three standard STLplus exceptions that can be thrown by ntree, all indicating a
misuse of the iterators:</p>

<dl>

<dt><strong>null_dereference</strong> - logic_error</dt>

<dd>This is used to indicate that an iterator which is null has been dereferenced. You should always
be sure that iterators are non-null before using the <code>*</code> or <code>-&gt;</code>
operators.</dd>

<dt><strong>end_dereference</strong> - logic_error</dt>

<dd>This is used to indicate that an iterator that is pointing to an end element has been
dereferenced. In line with STL conventions, the end iterator points to the element after the last
element in a container, so dereferencing such an iterator is illegal (the memory pointed to will be
unconstructed). In this case this happens when accessing the parent of the root node or using the
traversal iterators and walking off the end of the tree.</dd>

<dt><strong>wrong_object</strong> - logic_error</dt>

<dd>This is used to indicate that an iterator which was created by one container has been used in a
different container. For example, if you have two ntree objects in your program, create an iterator
from one ntree and then use it in another, then this will throw the wrong_object exception.</dd>

</dl>

<p>These exceptions are common to all STLplus iterators and are explained in
the STLplus <a href="exceptions.html">exceptions policy</a>.</p>

<p>In addition, an ntree can throw one C++ standard exception related to
the misuse of integer indices:</p>

<dl>

<dt><strong>std::out_of_range</strong> - logic_error</dt>

<dd>Thrown when an integer offset is used to access a child, where the offset
is out of range of the children.</dd>

</dl>
