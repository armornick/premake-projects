<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>This component is an infinite-precision integer type which, through operator
overloading, has been made to look as much as possible like a built-in integer
type. Thus you can add infs with a&nbsp;+&nbsp;b and increment it using i++. It
provides a full set of arithmetic, logical and shifting operations, type
conversions to and from all the C++ integer types, bitwise manipulation and
string representation and conversion in any base.</p>

<p>The inf class has been written for portability more than performance.
If you need a high-performance numeric library it is recommended that the Gnu Multi-Precision (GMP)
library is used; it is seriously fast.</p>


<h2 id="declaring">Declaring and Initialising inf objects</h2>

<p>The inf object looks a bit like an integer type and can be declared and
initialised in a similar way. However, there is one thing you cannot do, and
that is simply assign an integer value to it on creation. In other words, the
following will <strong>not</strong> work:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
inf b = 0;  // illegal
</pre>

<p>The reason for this is that, although the inf type has constructors that take
integer arguents, I've made them <em>explicit</em> which prevents them being used
by C++ to perform implicit type conversions (all 1-parameter constructors are
normally considered candidates for type conversions). I was concerned that C++
compilers can be over-keen on such type conversions and create nasty surprises
for users. Therefore, to initialise to an integer value, use the C++ constructor
form:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
inf c(0);
</pre>

<p>You may not realise this, but you can use this notation even with the standard
built-in integer types.</p>

<p>The other significant difference is that an
uninitialised inf will have the value zero - there is no such thing as an
unknown value.</p>

<p>For example, here is a way of creating an inf with the value zero:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
inf a;
</pre>

<p>An inf can be initialised from an expression using any C++
integer type - int, short, long and the unsigned variants of any of these. It
can also be initialised from another inf.</p>

<p>Typically, when using very large numbers, you will need to use string
representations to handle the initial value. The inf type will take a string
containing an integer value and convert it into an inf. The format of the string
can be any of the formats defined in
<a href="string_utilities.html">string_utilities</a>, so it can be a straight
decimal integer ("12345"), an octal integer ("012345"), a hexadecimal integer
("0x12345") or a hash-style integer ("12#12345"). Here's how you'd initialise an inf
with a googol (10<sup>100</sup>):</p>

<pre class="cpp">
inf googol("10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000");
</pre>


<h2 id="assignments">Assignments</h2>

<p>A full set of assignments is supported, from the six built-in integer types,
from a string representation and from another inf. These assignments have the
same characteristics as the initialisations just discussed.</p>

<p>Note that assignments are handled differently from initialisation by C++, so
you get the following strange effect:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
inf d = 0; // illegal
d = 0;     // legal
</pre>

<p>This seems strange until you realise that the first '=' operator is an
initialisation and in fact calls a constructor and not an assignment operator,
whilst the second is a true assignment.</p>


<h2 id="constants">Constant Values</h2>

<p>The last sections showed how an inf can be initialised or assigned from a
built-in integer type. However, sometimes an intermediate value of type inf is
required. I have disallowed implicit type conversion from in integer type to an
inf because, from experience, I know that allowing implicit type conversions
from integer types can cause the compiler to become
overly fond of type conversions to inf. You lose a lot of compiler checking as a
result. Therefore, intermediate values must be explicitly created. For example,
you <strong>cannot</strong> do this:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
a += 25;    // illegal
</pre>

<p>This is not legal because the += operator requires an inf as the argument and in this
case we have an int. The solution is to use the temporary-constructor notation
to form a temporary of type inf:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
a += inf(25);
</pre>

<p>This notation can be seen as the creation of an anonymous temporary object of
type inf which is initialised with an int argument. The resultant temporary can
then be passed as the right-hand argument of the += operator.</p>


<h2 id="conversions">Converting an inf to an integer type</h2>

<p>The inf class has a set of member functions which convert back to the basic
C++ integer types. To
convert to an int, use the to_int member function:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
inf a = "12345";
int i = a.to_int();
</pre>

<p>The full set of six conversions are available (for short, int and long and
their unsigned variants):</p>

<ul>
<li>to_short - converts to short</li>
<li>to_ushort - converts to unsigned short</li>
<li>to_int - converts to int</li>
<li>to_unsigned or to_uint - converts to unsigned</li>
<li>to_long - converts to long</li>
<li>to_ulong - converts to unsigned long</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that the names to_unsigned and to_uint are synonyms - 
my preference is to think of unsigned as a type rather than
as a variant of int (I write "unsigned" not "unsigned int"). I provided the to_uint for those who
think of unsigned as a modifier to int.</p>

<p>All of these methods have a <code>bool</code> argument which tells the method whether to
range-check the result before the conversion. For example, if the value is too big for type
<code>short</code>, then <code>to_short</code> has two possible responses. If checking is on, then
it will throw the exception <code>std::overflow_error</code>. If checking is off then it simply
truncates the value to fit the type, changing its value. The default is for checking to be off. The
method actually looks like:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
short inf::to_short(bool check = false) const throw(std::overflow_error)
</pre>


<h2 id="bits">Bit Manipulation</h2>

<p>An inf has a 2's-complement representation with any number of bits. It
follows the convention that bit 0 is the l.s.b. and the uppermost bit is the
sign bit. It is possible to access the bits of an inf and to change them. First,
you can get the number of bits in the representation and you can also set the
number of bits:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
unsigned bits = a.bits();
a.resize(bits + 1);
</pre>

<p>Furthermore, you can reduce the representation to the minimum size necessary
to represent the value stored:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
a.reduce();
</pre>

<p>The bits can be examined with either the bit function or the [] operator.</p>

<pre class="cpp">
for (unsigned i = 0; i &lt; a.bits(); i++)
  std::cout &lt;&lt; "bit " &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; " = " &lt;&lt; a[i] &lt;&lt; std::endl;
</pre>

<p>The result of the [] operator is a bool. The one difference with the array
index operator is that [] cannot be used as the target of an assignment. In
other words you <strong>cannot</strong> do this:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
a[0] = true;  // illegal
</pre>

<p>Instead, the bits of an inf can be set, cleared or preset to a bool value
using the set, clear and preset functions. So here are two ways of setting bit 0
to true:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
a.set(0);
a.preset(0, true);
</pre>

<p>The preset function is particularly useful when the bool value is the result
of an expression rather than a constant as here.</p>


<h2 id="tests">Value Tests</h2>

<p>There are a number of short-cut tests for the value of an inf so that you can
determine whether it is zero, natural, positive or negative. These are member
functions returning a bool:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
if (a.negative())
  ...
</pre>

<p>There are also implicit tests for zero and non-zero for use in conditionals
- either in if statements or in while loops (including the second field of a for
loop):</p>

<pre class="cpp">
if (a)  // tests for a having a value, i.e. non-zero
  ...
if (!b) // tests for b not having a value, i.e. zero
  ...
</pre>


<h2 id="comparisons">Comparisons</h2>

<p>The inf type has a full set of comparison operators - ==, !=, &lt;, &lt;=,
&gt; and &gt;=. Note however the comment earlier on the creation of intermediate
values, so this is illegal:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
if (a == 0)
  ...
</pre>

<p>You can fix this by either using the test for zero from the last section, or
(especially for other non-zero values) using the temporary-constructor
notation:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
if (a == inf(0))
  ...
</pre>


<h2 id="logical">Bitwise Logical Operations</h2>

<p>The inf type has a full set of bitwise logical operators which are divided
into two sets. The first set are the composite operator-assignments or
self-modifying operators such as &amp;=
which modify the inf:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
a &amp;= b;
</pre>

<p>This makes a the result of bitwise-anding the values of a and b.</p>

<p>The second set are the simple operators or value-returning opoerators which
return the result of the logical operation but do not modify either argument:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
c = a &amp; b;
</pre>

<p>This makes c the result of the bitwise-anding of the values of a and b.</p>

<p>These operators all normalise the result to the maximum length of the two
arguments, sign extends the shorter argument to the length of the longer one and
then performs the bitwise operation on these normalised values. Thus, the
bitwise-and of an 8-bit inf with a 16-bit inf is a 16-bit inf.</p>

<p>The self-modifying operations are: invert, &amp;=, |= and ^= (xor). The
value-returning operators are: ~, &amp;, | and ^.</p>


<h2 id="shift">Shift Operators</h2>

<p>The inf type can be shifted left or right. The shift distance is in fact
represented by an unsigned, not an inf. As with the logical operators, there are
both self-modifying and value-returning sets of these operators. The
self-modifying operators are: &lt;&lt;= and &gt;&gt;=. The value-returning
operators are: &lt;&lt; and &gt;&gt;.</p>

<p>Thus an inf can be shifted left by two bits using:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
a &lt;&lt; 2;
</pre>


<h2 id="arithmetic">Arithmetic Operations</h2>

<p>The inf type has a full set of arithmetic operations. Once again (yawn) they
are divided into self-modifying and value-returning functions. The
self-modifying operators are: negate, abs, +=, -=, *=, /= and %=. The
value-returning operators are: unary -, +, -, *, / and %.</p>

<p>It is worthwhile differentiating between the two versions of the abs
operation. The self-modifying form is called as a member function:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
a.abs();
</pre>

<p>This turns a into its absolute value. The value-returning form is called as a
non-member function:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
b = abs(a);
</pre>

<p>This makes b the absolute value of a without modifying a.</p>

<p>Note that the / and % operators can throw the inf::divide_by_zero
exception.</p>


<h2 id="increment">Increment and Decrement Operators</h2>

<p>The inf type can of course be used for mundane tasks such as loop counters
and for this purpose has a full set of increment and decrement operators. There
are two variants of these - pre-increment/decrement (e.g. ++i) and
post-increment/decrement (e.g. i++). The pre-increment operator increments the
value and returns the incremented value. the post-increment increments the value
but returns the previous non-incremented value.</p>


<h2 id="strings">String Representation and I/O</h2>

<p>An important part of the inf type is its string representation which allows
the type to be printed to the screen and saved to and restored from a file. The
string representation is consistent with the string representation of built-in
integers as provided by the <a href="string_utilities.html">string_utilities</a>
package. This supports the standard C formats of decimal ("12345"), octal
("012345"), binary ("0b010001010") and hexadecimal ("0x12345"). It also supports the STLplus-specific
hash format ("12#12345") which allows the use of any base from base 2 to base
36. There are conversions to/from string:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
std::string to_string(const inf&amp; i,
                      unsigned radix = 10,
                      radix_display_t display = radix_c_style_or_hash,
                      unsigned width = 0)
  throw(std::invalid_argument);

inf to_inf(const std::string&amp;, unsigned radix = 0)
  throw(std::invalid_argument);
</pre>

<p>Note that these are non-member functions. See the string_utilities
documentation for the meaning of the extra parameters. The default behaviour is
a simple decimal number.</p>

<p>There are also IOStream input (&gt;&gt;) and output
(&lt;&lt;) operators
for the inf type so that integer values can be written to and read from a file
or other I/O device:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
inf a = "12345";
std::cout &lt;&lt; "the value is " &lt;&lt; a &lt;&lt; std::endl;
</pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre class="cpp">
inf a;
std::cin &gt;&gt; a;
</pre>

<p>As an example, here's the code to generate and display a googol. As you may
know, a googol is a one followed by a hundred zeroes:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
inf googol(1);
for (unsigned j = 0; j &lt; 100; j++)
  googol *= inf(10);
std::cout &lt;&lt; "a googol is:" &lt;&lt; std::endl;
for (unsigned radix = 2; radix &lt;= 36; radix++)
  std::cout &lt;&lt; "base " &lt;&lt; radix &lt;&lt; " = " &lt;&lt; to_string(googol, radix) &lt;&lt; std::endl;
</pre>

<p>This code prints the googol in every radix from 2 to 36. The output looks like this:</p>

<pre class="terminal">
a googol is:
base 2 = 0b0100100100100110101101001001011001010011000011011111001110101100001011001001111000010011000100110011100000101111110011100010101100111001000000100011100010000100011010011111001010101010110010010000110000100010101000001011101000111100010000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

<h2 id="exceptions">Exceptions</h2>

<p>The inf class can throw exceptions, though of course only under exceptional
conditions. The following exceptions can be thrown:</p>

<dl>
<dt>std::out_of_range</dt>
<dd>Thrown by bit-index operations if the indexed bit is out of range of the
number of bits.</dd>

<dt>std::overflow_error</dt>
<dd>Thrown by conversion functions when converting to C++ integer types if the
inf's value will not fit</dd>

<dt>std::invalid_argument</dt>
<dd>Thrown by the string conversion functions if the string does not have the
right format for an integer value</dd>

<dt>inf::divide_by_zero</dt>
<dd>Thrown by the divide (/) and remainder (%) operators if the right-hand
argument is zero.</dd>

</dl>

<p>Note that all but the last of these are defined in the std:: namespace. This
is because they are standard exceptions and are defined in the standard library
header &lt;stdexcept&gt;. The last exception is declared within the inf class
and is therefore in the inf:: namespace. This was defined because there isn't an
appropriate standard exception for this job.</p>

<p>All of the exceptions that can be thrown by inf are derivatives of the
baseclass std::logic_error, so you can catch any of them with a single catch
clause:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
try
{
  ...
}
catch(std::logic_error&amp; except)
{
  ...
}
</pre>

<p>All logic error exceptions store a string with an error message in it. This
can be used to give more information on the cause of the error:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
catch (std::logic_error&amp; e)
{
  std::cout &lt;&lt; "caught exception " &lt;&lt; e.what() &lt;&lt; std::endl;
}
</pre>
