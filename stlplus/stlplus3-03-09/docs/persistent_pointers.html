<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Pointers are a special problem for persistent data types because there may be more than one
pointer to the same object in a data structure. If this was dumped in a naive way, there would be
two identical copies of the object in the dump, rather than one object and two pointers to it. It
would also be impossible to dump a structure with back pointers because the dump mechanism would get
stuck in an infinite recursion.</p>

<p>The dump function for a pointer will dump the object pointed to on the first visit to the object
along with a unique magic key that identifies the object pointed to. The second time the object is
visited (because there's a second pointer to it), only the magic key is dumped. On restoration, on
first encounter with the object, the object is restored and added to a map along with its magic key. 
When the magic key is found again in the input stream, it is converted by the map into a pointer to
the already-restored object.</p>

<h2 id="include">Header persistent_pointers.hpp</h2>

<ul>
<li class="external"><a href="persistent_pointers_hpp.html">Browse Header persistent_pointers.hpp</a></li>
</ul>

<p>You can include all of the pointer-handling functions in one go by including persistent_pointers.hpp. If you prefer
however, you can include the separate headers for each class being used.</p>

<h2 id="pointer">Persistent Pointer</h2>

<ul>
<li class="external"><a href="persistent_pointer_hpp.html">Browse Header persistent_pointer.hpp</a></li>
</ul>

<p>There is a template function pair dump_pointer/restore_pointer which implements the algorithm
described in the introduction. It assumes that a pointer points to a single object (for example, an
int* points to an int). Pointers to arrays of objects cannot be supported in this way and will need
to be hand-implemented (you need to know the size of the array as well to be able to dump it). You
should be using vectors anyway!</p>

<pre class="cpp">
template&lt;typename T, typename D&gt;
void stlplus::dump_pointer(stlplus::dump_context&amp;, const T* const data, D dump_fn)
  throw(stlplus::persistent_dump_failed);

template&lt;typename T, typename R&gt;
void stlplus::restore_pointer(stlplus::restore_context&amp;, T*&amp; data, R restore_fn)
  throw(stlplus::persistent_restore_failed);
</pre>

<p>Thus, dump_pointer will dump a magic key to the file and then, if this is the first visit, it
will call dump on the object being pointed to. You need to provide that dump function if it doesn't
already exist. Similarly, the restore function restores the magic key, checks to see if it is a new
key and if it is it restores the contents of the pointer. If it is an already-restored key, then it
is simply mapped onto its target object.</p>

<h2 id="cstring">Persistent char*</h2>

<p>The one exception to the handling of pointers is char* which is treated as a null terminated
array and not a pointer to a single char. It is treated as a basic type, not a pointer type - see <a
href="persistent_basic.html#cstring">persistence of basic types</a>. However, multiple
pointers to the same char array will be dumped once and the same magic key method used as for
pointers to other types.</p>

<h2 id="xrefs">Persistent Cross-References</h2>

<ul>
<li class="external"><a href="persistent_xref_hpp.html">Browse Header persistent_xref.hpp</a></li>
</ul>

<p>In principle, the approach described should cope with data structures of any complexity. However, there
may be subtle side-effects with the approach - as there tend to be with recursive algorithms - which
means that some data structures cannot be made persistent. I recomment that you design data
structures in a top-down way, using STL and STLplus containers rather than linking structs with
pointers. For example, use the digraph to represent arbitrary connections between objects rather
than having a mess of pointers.</p>

<p>If you really need pointers between objects, design the data structure with a primary structure
which is top-down and does all the memory management using containers. Then implement back- or
up-links using pointers which are treated as cross-references, i.e. pointers that are used as simple
addresses but which must not be deleted. The key to dumping such a structure is to determine the
primary structure and dump that. Then, in a second pass, dump cross-references.

<p>To support this situation, I provide a pair of functions for making such cross-references
persistent. The rule is that the object referred to must be dumped before the cross-reference to it.
In all other respects, it implements the magic key algorithm for persistence of pointers.</p>

<p>The interface is:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
template&lt;typename T&gt;
void stlplus::dump_xref(stlplus::dump_context&amp;, const T* const data)
  throw(stlplus::persistent_dump_failed);

template&lt;typename T&gt;
void stlplus::restore_xref(stlplus::restore_context&amp;, T*&amp; data)
  throw(stlplus::persistent_restore_failed);
</pre>

<p>The importance of dumping the primary structure first should be clear from this - dumping the
primary links first causes the data structures to be dumped in this pass since each object will be
visited for the first time. When back pointers or cross pointers are dumped, all the objects they
are pointing to have already been dumped so only magic keys get dumped.</p>

<h2 id="interfaces">Persistence of Polymorphic Classes using Interfaces</h2>

<ul>
<li class="external"><a href="persistent_interface_hpp.html">Browse Header persistent_interface.hpp</a></li>
</ul>

<p>In C++ you can define a superclass and then derive subclasses from it (some
people prefer the terminology baseclass for superclass and derived class for
subclass). This set of classes based on a common superclass is referred to as
a set of Polymorphic classes.</p>

<p>Polymorphic classes are manipulated through a pointer to the superclass.
The pointer can then point to any object of any subclass of the common
superclass. Subclass-specific operations are provided through the use of
virtual functions.</p>

<p>If this is still making no sense, you need to read a book on C++ since the
purpose of this document is to explain the STLplus, not to teach C++ basics.
Otherwise, the rest of this section is on how to make Polymorphic classes
persistent.</p>

<p>Polymorphic classes represent a problem for persistence. So far all the
persistence functions have used knowledge of the exact type of the object at
compile time to select the correct dump or restore function.
However, with polymorphism, only the superclass is known from the type of the
pointer. The actual subclass being pointed to is unknown at compile time and
must be determined at run time. This means that run-time type information must
be used to determine the type. This is usually achieved by defining virtual
methods.</p>

<p>This is the solution used to make polymorphic types persistent - although
there is an alternative implementation that uses callback functions instead
which is described in the <a href="#callback">next section</a>.</p>

<p>The set of virtual functions used to make a class persistent is defined by an 
<a href="interfaces.html">interface</a> called persistent. To
make a polymorphic class persistent, the first stage is to derive the base
class of your family of polymorphic classes from this interface.</p>

<pre class="cpp">
#include "persistent.hpp"

class base : public stlplus::persistent
</pre>

<p>The persistent interface defines a set of abstract methods that you
must provide for all subclasses to be made persistent:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
class stlplus::persistent
{
public:
  virtual void dump(dump_context&amp;) const throw(persistent_dump_failed) = 0;
  virtual void restore(restore_context&amp;) throw(persistent_restore_failed) = 0;
  virtual persistent* clone(void) const = 0;
  virtual ~persistent(void) {}
};
</pre>

<p>The clone method is also required by the
<a href="smart_ptr.html">smart_ptr_clone</a> container which is also
used to store polymorphic classes, so once you've made a class persistent,
you've automatically made it suitable for use in this smart pointer.</p>

<p>For an example of how to use this interface, see the <a
href="persistent_examples.html#interfaces">examples</a>.</p>

<p>Persistence of Polymorphic classes requires that every derivative class be registered with the
dump_context or restore_context before the dump or restore operation commences. Furthermore,
where there are many polymorphic types being handled, the order
of registration must be the same for the restore operation as it was for the dump
operation.</p>

<p>Consider first the dump operation. The stlplus::dump_context class provides
the following method for registration:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
unsigned short dump_context::register_interface(const std::type_info&amp; info);
</pre>

<p>This is called once for each polymorphic type to be dumped.</p>

<p>The std::type_info type is obtained from the typeid operator which is built-in to C++ and
provides a means of getting the type name from a type or expression as a char*. This is mapped
internally onto a magic key which is an integer value unique to that subclass. The return value of
the register_interface method is a magic key for that type and is used in the dump to differentiate
between the different classes. There's no real reason for capturing this key except maybe for
debugging the data stream. Keys are allocated in the order of registration of class types. This is
why class types must be registered in the same order for both the dump and restore operations.</p>

<p>For the restore operation it is necessary to register a sample object of the
class. This is because the restore operation creates objects of the class by
cloning the sample.</p>

<p>The stlplus::restore_context class provides the following registration function:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
typedef smart_ptr_clone&lt;persistent&gt; persistent_ptr;

unsigned short restore_context::register_interface(const persistent_ptr&amp;);
</pre>

<p>The objects are registered in the same order as the types were registered
into the dump context, because it is this ordering that provides the mapping
from the unique key used in the dump to the correct sample object used in
the restore.</p>

<p>Now that the classes are registered, the actual dump and restore of a
superclass pointer is handled by the following functions:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
template&lt;typename T&gt;
void stlplus::dump_interface(stlplus::dump_context&amp;, const T* const data)
  throw(stlplus::persistent_dump_failed);

template&lt;typename T&gt;
void stlplus::restore_interface(stlplus::restore_context&amp;, T*&amp; data)
  throw(stlplus::persistent_restore_failed);
</pre>


<p><strong>Note</strong>: since polymorphic types are handled in C++ via pointers, the
same behaviour is implemented for multiple pointers to the same object as was
implemented for simple pointers. When two pointers to the same object are
dumped, they will be restored as pointers
to the same object.</p>

<h2 id="callback">Persistence of Polymorphic Classes using Callbacks</h2>

<ul>
<li class="external"><a href="persistent_callback_hpp.html">Browse Header persistent_callback.hpp</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="#interfaces">previous section</a> described how polymorphic types could be made
persistent in an object-oriented way through inheritance and virtual methods. However, it is not
always possible to use this approach. For example, you might want to make a class persistent that
you cannot change. Therefore an alternative solution is needed that uses a non-intrusive approach to
persistence. In order to achieve this non-intrusive approach, I have provided the option to use dump
and restore <em>callbacks</em> to perform the persistence functionality and <em>not</em> virtuals. The
callbacks are associated with the subclass, which can be determined at run time. The callbacks are
stored in the stlplus::dump_context object during the dump and in the stlplus::restore_context
object during a restore.</p>

<p>During restore, it is also necessary to create an object of the right subclass before its restore
callback can be called. The solution uses create callbacks rather than sample objects. A create
callback is a function that, when called, creates an object and returns a pointer to it. In order to
make the method as general as possible, the create callback returns this pointer as a void*.</p>

<p>Thus, the non-intrusive solution to persistence of polymorphic types requires no changes to
existing classes - no extra virtual functions for example. However, the cost of this solution is
that it does require three callback functions to be written for each subclass to be made
persistent.</p>

<p>For an example of how to use this approach, see the <a
href="persistent_examples.html#polymorphic">examples</a>.</p>

<p>The parameter profiles of the three callbacks is:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
void dump_<em>class</em>(stlplus::dump_context&amp; context, const void* data)
void* create_<em>class</em>(void)
void restore_<em>class</em>(stlplus::restore_context&amp; context, void*&amp; data)
</pre>

<p>The persistence of Polymorphic classes requires that every polymorphic class be registered with
the dump_context or restore_context before the dump or restore operation commences. Furthermore,
where there are many polymorphic types being handled, the order of registration must be the same for
the restore operation as it was for the dump operation.</p>

<p>Consider first the dump operation. The dump_context class provides
the following method for registration:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
unsigned short dump_context::register_type(const std::type_info&amp; info, dump_callback);
</pre>

<p>The dump_context::register_type method is called once for each polymorphic type to be dumped.</p>

<p>The std::type_info type is obtained from the typeid operator which is built-in to C++ and
provides a means of getting the type name from a type or expression as a char*. This is mapped
internally onto a magic key which is an integer value unique to that subclass. The return value of
the register_type method is the magic key for that type and is used in the dump to differentiate
between the different classes. There's no real reason for capturing this key except maybe for
debugging the data stream. Keys are allocated in the order of registration of class types. This is
why class types must be registered in the same order for both the dump and restore operations.</p>

<p>For the restore operation it is necessary to register both a create callback and a restore
callback with the restore context. The restore_context class provides the following registration
function:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
unsigned short restore_context::register_type(create_callback,restore_callback);
</pre>

<p>The callbacks are registered in the same order as the types were registered
into the dump context, because it is this ordering that provides the mapping
from the unique key used in the dump to the correct create callback used in
the restore.</p>

<p>Now that the callbacks are registered, the actual dump and restore of a
superclass pointer is handled by the following functions:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
template&lt;typename T&gt;
void dump_callback(dump_context&amp;, const T* const data)
  throw(persistent_dump_failed);

template&lt;typename T&gt;
void restore_callback(restore_context&amp;, T*&amp; data)
  throw(persistent_restore_failed);
</pre>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: since polymorphic types are handled in C++ via pointers, the
same behaviour is implemented for multiple pointers to the same object as was
implemented for simple pointers. When two pointers to the same object are
dumped, they will be restored as pointers
to the same object.</p>

<h2 id="installer">Installer Functions</h2>

<p>An alternative way of registering either interfaces or callbacks is to wrap their
registration up in an installer function. This installer can then be used to
install all classes in a single step.</p>

<p>In fact, two installer functions are required - one for dumping and one for
restoring. It is up to you to check that these installer functions install
their callbacks in the same order. The type profiles for these installer
functions are:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
void (*dump_context::installer)(stlplus::dump_context&amp;);
void (*restore_context::installer)(stlplus::restore_context&amp;);
</pre>

<p>In other words, the installer type for a stlplus::dump_context is a pointer to a
function that takes a stlplus::dump_context&amp; and returns void. Similarly the
installer type for a stlplus::restore_context is a pointer to a function that takes a
stlplus::restore_context&amp; and returns void. For the interface approach they might look
like this:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
void register_dumpers(stlplus::dump_context&amp; context)
{
  context.register_interface(typeid(base));
  context.register_interface(typeid(derived));
}

void register_restorers(stlplus::restore_context&amp; context)
{
  context.register_interface(base());
  context.register_interface(derived());
}
</pre>

<p>The functions can be called whatever you like. In use, after creating a dump or restore context, call the
method register_all with the above installer function's name as the argument. For example,
using the earlier example again, rewritten to use an installer:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
stlplus::dump_context context(output);
context.register_all(register_dumpers);
</pre>

<p>Alternatively, an installer function can be used with the callback approach:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
void register_dumpers(stlplus::dump_context&amp; context)
{
  context.register_type(typeid(base),dump_base);
  context.register_type(typeid(derived),dump_derived);
}

void register_restorers(stlplus::restore_context&amp; context)
{
  context.register_type(create_base,restore_base);
  context.register_type(create_derived,restore_derived);
}
</pre>

<h2 id="smart_ptr">Persistence of Smart Pointers</h2>

<ul>
<li class="external"><a href="persistent_smart_ptr_hpp.html">Browse Header persistent_smart_ptr.hpp</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The STLplus <a href="smart_ptr.html">smart pointer classes</a> are a
special case of template container classes in that they contain pointers to
objects, whereas most template containers contain objects themselves.
Therefore, persistence of smart pointers is implemented by calling the
persistence functions for pointers.</p>

<p>There are two interpretations of pointers though: a simple pointer to an object of a known type
and a polymorphic pointer which has the type of a pointer to a superclass but which can in fact
point to any subclass of the pointer type. These two interpretations are handled by two variants of
the smart pointer classes: the smart_ptr variant is intended for use with simple pointers and the
smart_ptr_clone variant is intended for use with polymorphic pointers.</p>

<p>The smart_ptr variant therefore uses the persistence functions for simple pointers (see <a
href="#pointer">Persistent Pointer</a>).</p>

<p>The smart_ptr_clone variant uses the
persistence for polymorphic pointers. Indeed, both the interface approach (see <a
href="#interfaces">Persistence of Polymorphic Classes using Interfaces</a>) and callback approach
(see <a href="#callback">Persistence of Polymorphic Classes using Callbacks</a>) are implemented on
the smart_ptr_clone class.</p>

<p>This gives three different implementations of persistence for smart pointers:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
// smart_ptr - uses dump/restore_pointer on the contents

template&lt;typename T, typename DE&gt;
void stlplus::dump_smart_ptr(stlplus::dump_context&amp;, const smart_ptr&lt;T&gt;&amp; data, DE dump_element)
  throw(stlplus::persistent_dump_failed);

template&lt;typename T, typename RE&gt;
void stlplus::restore_smart_ptr(stlplus::restore_context&amp;, smart_ptr&lt;T&gt;&amp; data, RE restore_element)
  throw(stlplus::persistent_restore_failed);

// smart_ptr_clone using the polymorphic callback approach - uses dump/restore_callback on the contents

template&lt;typename T&gt;
void stlplus::dump_smart_ptr_clone_callback(stlplus::dump_context&amp;, const smart_ptr_clone&lt;T&gt;&amp; data)
  throw(stlplus::persistent_dump_failed);

template&lt;typename T&gt;
void stlplus::restore_smart_ptr_clone_callback(stlplus::restore_context&amp;, smart_ptr_clone&lt;T&gt;&amp; data)
  throw(stlplus::persistent_restore_failed);

// smart_ptr_clone using the interface approach - uses dump/restore_interface on the contents

template&lt;typename T&gt;
void stlplus::dump_smart_ptr_clone_interface(stlplus::dump_context&amp;, const smart_ptr_clone&lt;T&gt;&amp; data)
  throw(stlplus::persistent_dump_failed);

template&lt;typename T&gt;
void stlplus::restore_smart_ptr_clone_interface(stlplus::restore_context&amp;, smart_ptr_clone&lt;T&gt;&amp; data)
  throw(stlplus::persistent_restore_failed);
</pre>
