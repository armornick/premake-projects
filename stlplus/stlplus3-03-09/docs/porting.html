<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>My intention is to port the STLplus library to as many platforms as I can reasonably support.</p>


<p><a href="http://sourceforge.net/">SourceForge</a>, which hosts
STLplus, used to provide a Compile Farm so that I could test STLplus
on different platforms. So in the past, the library collection has
been extensively tested on a wide range of platforms. This enabled me,
for example, to fix problems with data persistence on 64-bit CPUs and
to provide a MacOS port. Unfortunately, the Compile Farm has now been
withdrawn, so I can only test the library on my own Windows and Linux
PCs. However, this setup means that I can still test against a range
of compiler/platform combinations, including gcc on Linux, gcc on
Windows using the Cygwin Unix emulator, Windows native builds using
Visual Studio and Windows native builds using the MinGW version of the
gcc compiler.</p>

<h2 id="issues">Porting Status</h2>

<p>There are a number of porting issues to be overcome:</p>

<dl>

<dt>Different Operating Systems</dt>

<dd>

<p>One of the objectives of this library is to provide platform-independent
access to operating system services that differ between platforms. The idea is
to hide the implementation behind a common interface. By writing software to
that interface, you automatically get portable software. At least, that is the
theory.</p>

<p>STLplus has been built on the following Operating Systems:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Windows
    <ul>
      <li>NT</li>
      <li>2000</li>
      <li>XP</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Linux
    <ul>
      <li>Debian</li>
      <li>RedHat</li>
      <li>Suse</li>
      <li>Ubuntu</li>
      <li>Cygwin (linux emulation on Windows)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>other Unix
    <ul>
      <li>Open BSD</li>
      <li>Net BSD</li>
      <li>Free BSD</li>
      <li>Solaris</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>MacOS
    <ul>
      <li>X (Darwin)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

</dd>

<dt>Different CPU Architectures</dt>

<dd>

<p>Different CPUs have different word lengths, different byte ordering
and different integer type definitions. The intention is that STLplus
will work with all variations of these characteristics that I come
across.</p>

<p>STLplus has been built on the following CPUs:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Intel Pentium 686 (32-bit)</li>
  <li>AMD Opteron (64-bit)</li>
  <li>IBM OpenPower (32-bit)</li>
  <li>DEC Alpha (64-bit)</li>
  <li>Sun Sparc (32-bit)</li>
  <li>Power PC (32-bit)</li>
  <li>Power PC (64-bit)</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt>Different Compilers</dt>

<dd>

<p>The concept of portability means portability between operating
systems, not necessarily portability between compilers. However, to
cater for different tastes in compilers, I have supported as many as I
have access to.</p>

<p>It is also important that software will build with different
versions of each compiler, because I have no control over which
compiler you are using and there's a good chance that you don't
either.  The STLplus library should ideally work in whatever
development environment you have chosen (within reason). So, STLplus
works with different releases of these compilers, not just the latest
one.</p>

<p>STLplus has been built on the following compilers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Visual Studio
    <ul>
      <li>v6 - if patched to SP5</li>
      <li>v7 (.NET)</li>
      <li>v8 (2005)</li>
      <li>v9 (2008)</li>
      <li>v10 (2010)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Gnu gcc
    <ul>
      <li>v2, v2.95 onwards - tried on v2.95</li>
      <li>v3 - tried on v3.3, v3.4</li>
      <li>v4 - tried on v4.3, v4.4, v4.5</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Borland
    <ul>
      <li>v5.5 (Free Command-line Tools)</li>
      <li>v5.8 (Turbo C++ 2006 Explorer)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>On each operating system there are a number of different
development environments available:</p>

<ul>

  <li>Windows
    <ul>
      <li>Visual Studio</li>
      <li>Borland</li>
      <li>native Windows using gnu gcc on <a href="http://www.mingw.org/">MinGW</a></li>
      <li>Unix-emulation on Windows using gnu gcc on <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>all Linux / Unix
    <ul>
      <li>gnu gcc</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>MacOS X
    <ul>
      <li>gnu gcc</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

</ul>


</dd>

</dl>

<p>I refer to a "platform" as a particular combination of CPU, Operating System and Compiler.</p>

<p>These requirements create some limitations on the extent of the library - the primary objective
is for it to be portable such that it presents exactly the same interface on all platforms. This
means that I do not have anything that cannot be implemented on all platforms with all supported
compilers.</p>

<p>For example there's no Unicode support because some compilers have little or no support for
Unicode and there are major differences in how Unicode is implemented on different operating
systems. There are other libraries that deal with this issue better than I can and so I consider it
beyond the scope of the STLplus library to resolve it.</p>

<h2 id="progress">Porting Testing</h2>

<p>If you can confirm the library works on any other platform or compiler combination, please let me
know the details - Compiler, Compiler version, OS, CPU etc.</p>

<p>The following table shows the platforms that STLplus3 has been tested on <em>recently</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Note 1</strong>: The -D directive is a C macro that selects between
different implementations of code for different platforms. For example, a
Windows application will use different system calls to a Unix application. The
correct directive for the platform must be defined for the STLplus library to
build on the target platform. Typically this is set as an option to the
compiler - for example with the gcc compiler you would specify "<code>gcc
-DSOLARIS</code>" when building on Solaris. The _WIN32 value that selects the
Windows native build is set automatically by the compilers so you don't have
to do this. If no -D directive is shown, then the default build is a generic
Unix build and needs no special rules. See the documentation on <a
href="building.html">building the library</a> for more on this.</p>
