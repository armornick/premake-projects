<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The CLI parser component is a general-purpose command-line processor
intended for simplifying the creation of command-line tools. It performs three
functions: parsing of the command line; reading default values from an Ini
file; implementing built-in default values.</p>

<p>The parser works off a set of parameter definitions. These define the set
of command line options and their behaviour. It also determines whether the
command can take arguments or only options.</p>

<p>Associated with each definition is a default value. These are stored in the
command-line parser and become the initial values of the options. These may
later be overridden from the Ini files or from the command-line itself.</p>

<p>The parser can also optionally read default values from an Ini file, managed by the
<a href="ini_manager.html">ini_manager</a> component. These are in addition to
the built-in default values, not instead of them.</p>

<p>Finally, the command-line itself is read and options specified from the
command line added to the set of values.</p>

<p>The processed command line is then accessed by indexing into an array - a
bit like reading argv, except that options and their values are combined into
a single element. Default values appear in this array so that default values
are handled in the same way as command-line values. The idea is that you
simply process the options from left to right and by doing so you
automatically get all the options including built-in defaults, Ini-file
defaults and user-specified options.</p>

<p>The following sections will make all this clearer.</p>


<h2 id="initialisation">Initialisation</h2>

<p>The command-liner parser has a multi-stage initialisation phase. Some of
the stages in the initialisation are compulsory and some are optional. The
following stages are processed in the order given:</p>

<dl>

<dt>Set up an error handler (required)</dt>

<dd><p>The CLI parser contains a reference to an error handler (see
<a href="message_handler.html">message_handler.hpp</a>). Since this is a
reference, it must be initialised by a constructor. The CLI parser cannot be
used (at present) without an error handler since syntax errors in the
command-line and Ini-files are reported using the error handler.</p></dd>

<dt>Set up definitions (required)</dt>

<dd><p>The set of options supported are set up in the CLI parser by passing it
a set of definitions. There are two representations of these definitions.
There is a C-like form which is good for declaring definitions as a static
structure and there's a C++ form which is good for building definitions
dynamically. Both forms support the concept of built-in default values for
each option.</p></dd>

<dt>Read default values from an ini-file (optional)</dt>

<dd><p>The built-in default values can be overridden by default values
specified in an ini-file
(see <a href="ini_manager.html">ini_manager.hpp</a>.
This is an optional step since not all programs require that level of
configuration.</p></dd>

<dt>Parse the command-line (optional)</dt>

<dd><p>The command line, or at least a command-line-like structure is then
parsed to check that it conforms to the syntax defined by the definitions.
This is made optional because the CLI parser can make a convenient interface
to configuration files, simplifying further the interface to the ini-files.</p></dd>

</dl>

<p>The command-line parser has a large number of constructors representing the
most common combinations of initialisations:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
class stlplus::cli_parser
{
public:
  cli_parser(stlplus::message_handler&amp; errors);

  cli_parser(stlplus::cli_definitions_t, stlplus::message_handler&amp; errors) throw(stlplus::cli_mode_error);
  cli_parser(stlplus::cli_definitions_t, const stlplus::ini_manager&amp; defaults, const std::string&amp; ini_section, stlplus::message_handler&amp; errors) throw(stlplus::cli_mode_error);
  cli_parser(char* argv[], stlplus::cli_definitions_t, stlplus::message_handler&amp; errors) throw(stlplus::cli_mode_error);
  cli_parser(char* argv[], stlplus::cli_definitions_t, const stlplus::ini_manager&amp; defaults, const std::string&amp; ini_section, stlplus::message_handler&amp; errors) throw(stlplus::cli_mode_error);

  cli_parser(stlplus::cli_definitions, stlplus::message_handler&amp; errors) throw(stlplus::cli_mode_error);
  cli_parser(stlplus::cli_definitions, const stlplus::ini_manager&amp; defaults, const std::string&amp; ini_section, stlplus::message_handler&amp; errors) throw(stlplus::cli_mode_error);
  cli_parser(char* argv[], stlplus::cli_definitions, stlplus::message_handler&amp; errors) throw(stlplus::cli_mode_error);
  cli_parser(char* argv[], stlplus::cli_definitions, const stlplus::ini_manager&amp; defaults, const std::string&amp;
ini_section, stlplus::message_handler&amp; errors) throw(stlplus::cli_mode_error);
};
</pre>

<p>The parser must have a <a href="message_handler.html">stlplus::message_handler</a> to
report parsing errors and to report usage information. Therefore all
constructors require this field. The first constructor only sets up the error
handler but defers all other initialisations.</p>

<p>All parsers must also have a set of definitions (defined in the next
section). When using the first constructor, you must explicitly set up the
definitions using the add_definitions or add_definition (note the plural
versus the singular). All the other constructors include this stage.</p>

<p>The second constructor does both jobs - it sets up the error handler and
sets up the definitions. Note that if there is an error in the definitions an
exception is thrown.</p>

<p>The third constructor does these jobs but also reads default values
from an Ini-file. You have to use the <a
href="ini_manager.html">stlplus::ini_manager</a> class to manage the Ini files. You
also have to state which section of the Ini file to read - Ini files are
divided into sections, typically one for each tool in a set of tools. It is
recommended that default command-line options are stored in an Ini-file
section with the same name as the command, but this is a recommendation not a
rule.</p>

<p>The fourth constructor sets up the error handler, sets up the definitions
and then parses the command line. It excludes the ini-file handling.</p>

<p>The fifth constructor includes all of the stages.</p>

<p>The remaining four constructors do the same job but with the C++ version of
the definitions structure rather than the C form.</p>

<p>If you wish, you can perform each task separately. In that case, you must
set up the stlplus::message_handler first since that is required by the first
constructor. The definitions should be added next, followed by the Ini-file
defaults (optional) and then the comamnd-line parsing.</p>

<p>Also, if you prefer to set of the definitions one by one, you can do
so.</p>

<p>The support functions for the step-by-step approach are:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
void cli_parser::add_definitions(definitions) throw(stlplus::cli_mode_error);
unsigned cli_parser::add_definition(const definition&amp;) throw(stlplus::cli_mode_error);
void cli_parser::set_defaults(const stlplus::ini_manager&amp; defaults, const std::string&amp; ini_section);
bool parse(char* argv[]);
</pre>


<h2 id="definitions">Option Definitions</h2>

<p>The command-line parser is initialised with a set of definitions for the
options supported by the application. There are two ways of creating
definitions - what I refer to as a C form and a C++ form.</p>

<p>The C form is a C array (not a vector) of C structs. This is a form that
can be used in a static declaration. It can also be a very compact form
because it can be declared using the C aggregate notation. For example:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
stlplus::cli_definitions_t definitions =
  {
    {"help",    stlplus::cli_switch_kind, stlplus::cli_single_mode,   "VLIBRARY_USAGE_HELP",    0},
    {"map",     stlplus::cli_value_kind,  stlplus::cli_multiple_mode, "VLIBRARY_USAGE_MAP",     0},
    {"create",  stlplus::cli_value_kind,  stlplus::cli_multiple_mode, "VLIBRARY_USAGE_CREATE",  0},
    {"add",     stlplus::cli_value_kind,  stlplus::cli_multiple_mode, "VLIBRARY_USAGE_ADD",     0},
    {"remove",  stlplus::cli_value_kind,  stlplus::cli_multiple_mode, "VLIBRARY_USAGE_REMOVE",  0},
    {"delete",  stlplus::cli_value_kind,  stlplus::cli_multiple_mode, "VLIBRARY_USAGE_DELETE",  0},
    {"work",    stlplus::cli_value_kind,  stlplus::cli_multiple_mode, "VLIBRARY_USAGE_WORK",    0},
    {"lock",    stlplus::cli_switch_kind, stlplus::cli_multiple_mode, "VLIBRARY_USAGE_LOCK",    0},
    {"unlock",  stlplus::cli_switch_kind, stlplus::cli_multiple_mode, "VLIBRARY_USAGE_UNLOCK",  0},
    {"tidy",    stlplus::cli_switch_kind, stlplus::cli_multiple_mode, "VLIBRARY_USAGE_TIDY",    0},
    {"verbose", stlplus::cli_switch_kind, stlplus::cli_single_mode,   "VLIBRARY_USAGE_VERBOSE", 0},
    {"version", stlplus::cli_switch_kind, stlplus::cli_single_mode,   "VLIBRARY_USAGE_VERSION", "on"},
    END_CLI_DEFINITIONS
  };
</pre>

<p>The above example only contains static values and therefore could be
declared in any static (file) scope. Note how the suffix "_t" has been used.
This is a common convention for C types and I have used this notation to
reinforce the C-like nature of these structures. The last element of the
aggregate must be the macro END_CLI_DEFINITIONS so that the end of the array
can be detected by the cli_manager.</p>

<p>This C-like form is not limited to static scope however, it can also be used
within a function, in which case it can use variables for its values:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
stlplus::cli_definitions_t definitions =
  {
    {"help",    stlplus::cli_switch_kind, stlplus::cli_single_mode,   "VLIBRARY_USAGE_HELP",    0},
    {"map",     stlplus::cli_value_kind,  stlplus::cli_multiple_mode, "VLIBRARY_USAGE_MAP",     map_file.c_str()},
    {"create",  stlplus::cli_value_kind,  stlplus::cli_multiple_mode, "VLIBRARY_USAGE_CREATE",  0},
    {"add",     stlplus::cli_value_kind,  stlplus::cli_multiple_mode, "VLIBRARY_USAGE_ADD",     0},
    {"remove",  stlplus::cli_value_kind,  stlplus::cli_multiple_mode, "VLIBRARY_USAGE_REMOVE",  0},
    {"delete",  stlplus::cli_value_kind,  stlplus::cli_multiple_mode, "VLIBRARY_USAGE_DELETE",  0},
    {"work",    stlplus::cli_value_kind,  stlplus::cli_multiple_mode, "VLIBRARY_USAGE_WORK",    0},
    {"lock",    stlplus::cli_switch_kind, stlplus::cli_multiple_mode, "VLIBRARY_USAGE_LOCK",    0},
    {"unlock",  stlplus::cli_switch_kind, stlplus::cli_multiple_mode, "VLIBRARY_USAGE_UNLOCK",  0},
    {"tidy",    stlplus::cli_switch_kind, stlplus::cli_multiple_mode, "VLIBRARY_USAGE_TIDY",    0},
    {"verbose", stlplus::cli_switch_kind, stlplus::cli_single_mode,   "VLIBRARY_USAGE_VERBOSE", 0},
    {"version", stlplus::cli_switch_kind, stlplus::cli_single_mode,   "VLIBRARY_USAGE_VERSION", "on"},
    END_CLI_DEFINITIONS
  };
</pre>

<p>Note how the default value (the last element on the line) for the "map"
option now has its value defined by the return value from a function call.</p>

<p>The C++ form comes into its own if aspects of the definitions are
dynamically determined. This form is represented by a vector of classes. The
vector type is called stlplus::cli_definitions and the class that it contains
is stlplus::cli_definition (note again the plural and the singular).</p>

<p>The definition class has a constructor that makes it easy to set up. For
example:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
stlplus::cli_definitions definitions;
definitions.push_back(stlplus::cli_definition("help",    stlplus::cli_switch_kind, stlplus::cli_single_mode,   "VLIBRARY_USAGE_HELP",    0));
definitions.push_back(stlplus::cli_definition("map",     stlplus::cli_value_kind,  stlplus::cli_multiple_mode, "VLIBRARY_USAGE_MAP",     map_file.c_str()));
definitions.push_back(stlplus::cli_definition("create",  stlplus::cli_value_kind,  stlplus::cli_multiple_mode, "VLIBRARY_USAGE_CREATE",  0));
definitions.push_back(stlplus::cli_definition("add",     stlplus::cli_value_kind,  stlplus::cli_multiple_mode, "VLIBRARY_USAGE_ADD",     0));
definitions.push_back(stlplus::cli_definition("remove",  stlplus::cli_value_kind,  stlplus::cli_multiple_mode, "VLIBRARY_USAGE_REMOVE",  0));
definitions.push_back(stlplus::cli_definition("delete",  stlplus::cli_value_kind,  stlplus::cli_multiple_mode, "VLIBRARY_USAGE_DELETE",  0));
definitions.push_back(stlplus::cli_definition("work",    stlplus::cli_value_kind,  stlplus::cli_multiple_mode, "VLIBRARY_USAGE_WORK",    0));
definitions.push_back(stlplus::cli_definition("lock",    stlplus::cli_switch_kind, stlplus::cli_multiple_mode, "VLIBRARY_USAGE_LOCK",    0));
definitions.push_back(stlplus::cli_definition("unlock",  stlplus::cli_switch_kind, stlplus::cli_multiple_mode, "VLIBRARY_USAGE_UNLOCK",  0));
definitions.push_back(stlplus::cli_definition("tidy",    stlplus::cli_switch_kind, stlplus::cli_multiple_mode, "VLIBRARY_USAGE_TIDY",    0));
definitions.push_back(stlplus::cli_definition("verbose", stlplus::cli_switch_kind, stlplus::cli_single_mode,   "VLIBRARY_USAGE_VERBOSE", 0));
definitions.push_back(stlplus::cli_definition("version", stlplus::cli_switch_kind, stlplus::cli_single_mode,   "VLIBRARY_USAGE_VERSION", "on"));
</pre>

<p>Regardless of whether you use the C form or the C++ form, the option
definition has the same contents in the same order. Each option has five parts
to its definition: its name; its kind (switch or value); its mode (more
later); a message to print in the usage report (more later) and its default
value. The default value is optional - in the C form it is omitted by giving a
null char* as the value but in the C++ form it should be the empty string.</p>

<p>The types used in declaring definitions are:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
enum stlplus::cli_kind_t {stlplus::cli_switch_kind, stlplus::cli_value_kind};

enum stlplus::cli_mode_t {stlplus::cli_single_mode, stlplus::cli_multiple_mode, stlplus::cli_cumulative_mode};

// The C struct for definitions
struct stlplus::cli_definition_t
{
  const char* m_name;
  stlplus::cli_kind_t m_kind;
  stlplus::cli_mode_t m_mode;
  const char* m_message;
  const char* m_default;
};

// The C array of the C struct. The array must be terminated by END_CLI_DEFINITIONS.
typedef stlplus::cli_definition_t stlplus::cli_definitions_t [];
#define END_CLI_DEFINITIONS {0,stlplus::cli_switch_kind,stlplus::cli_single_mode,"",0}

// The C++ class for definitions
class stlplus::cli_definition
{
public:
  std::string m_name;
  stlplus::cli_kind_t m_kind;
  stlplus::cli_mode_t m_mode;
  std::string m_message;
  std::string m_default;

  cli_definition(const std::string&amp; name,
                 stlplus::cli_kind_t kind,
                 stlplus::cli_mode_t mode, 
                 const std::string&amp; message,
                 const std::string&amp; default_value = std::string());
};

// The C++ vector of the C++ class
typedef std::vector&lt;stlplus::cli_definition&gt; stlplus::cli_definitions;
</pre>

<p>The first field is the name of the option. On the command line they will
have to have a '-' prepended to indicate that this is an option, but this is
omitted from the name field. The empty string "" is used to define the
command-line arguments i.e. those values that are not associated with an
option. For example, if the application was called "DoIt", then the following
command has four arguments which will be associated with the "" option:</p>

<pre class="script">
DoIt one two three four
</pre>

<p>The following command will set the switch value "help" to its positive value:</p>

<pre class="script">
DoIt -help
</pre>

<p>There will be more on how to interpret the options later.</p>

<p>The second field is the kind of the options. There are two kinds - switch
and value. A switch is just on or off and has no following value, like the
"help" option given in the example above. Value options have a value following
them on the command line:</p>

<pre class="script">
DoIt -work test
</pre>

<p>In this example, the option "work" has the value "test" associated with
it.</p>

<p>The third field in the definition is the mode of the option. There are three
modes:</p>

<dl>

<dt>stlplus::cli_single_mode</dt>
<dd>Only a single instance of the option is kept. If the option appears more
than once, either in the command line or the default values, then the later
definition overrides the earlier ones, causing the earlier definitions to
disappear.</dd>

<dt>stlplus::cli_multiple_mode</dt>
<dd>There can be many instances of the option. All instaces at the same level
are kept, but instances from "higher" levels override "lower" levels. The
highest level is the command-line, followed by Ini-file defaults and the
lowest level is the set of built-in defaults. Thus the command-line overrides
all other levels, whilst the Ini-file overrides just the built-in
defaults.</dd>

<dt>stlplus::cli_cumulative_mode</dt>
<dd>There can be many instances of the option and all instances are kept
regardless of their level.</dd>

</dl>

<p>The fourth field in the definition is the mnemonic for a message to be
passed to the <a href="message_handler.html">stlplus::message_handler</a>. This is used in
help messages to give usage information for the application. The messages used
for this example command are:</p>

<pre class="script">
VLIBRARY_USAGE_HELP             \t-[no]help               # this help!
VLIBRARY_USAGE_MAP              \t-map &lt;path&gt;             # set the library mapping file (.lmf) to use - default is ./moods.lmf
VLIBRARY_USAGE_CREATE           \t-create &lt;name&gt;=&lt;path&gt;   # create a library called &lt;name&gt; in directory &lt;path&gt; and add to the list
VLIBRARY_USAGE_ADD              \t-add &lt;path&gt;             # add the library at &lt;path&gt; to the library list
VLIBRARY_USAGE_REMOVE           \t-remove &lt;name&gt;          # remove the library &lt;name&gt; from the library list
VLIBRARY_USAGE_DELETE           \t-delete &lt;name&gt;          # delete the library called &lt;name&gt; and its directory
VLIBRARY_USAGE_WORK             \t-work &lt;name&gt;            # make &lt;name&gt; the current work library
VLIBRARY_USAGE_LOCK             \t-lock                   # lock the work library
VLIBRARY_USAGE_UNLOCK           \t-unlock                 # unlock the work library
VLIBRARY_USAGE_TIDY             \t-tidy                   # tidy (erase) all out-of-date units in work
VLIBRARY_USAGE_VERBOSE          \t-[no]verbose            # verbose listing (list units in each library)
VLIBRARY_USAGE_VERSION          \t-[no]version            # display product version
</pre>

<p>These usage messages are parameterless. Note the use of \t (tab) to indent these
messages - it is recommended that you follow this example.</p>

<p>The last field in the definition is the built-in default value of the
option. It should be a null pointer if there is no default value, otherwise a
string representing the default value. Switch values should be defaulted to on
with the strings "on", "true" or "1" or to off with the strings "off", "false"
or "0". Note how the "map" option has a default in the example,
whereas the arguments field "" and the "work" option have no default.</p>


<h2 id="ini_files">Importing Defaults from Ini Files</h2>

<p>The command-line parser can import default values from an Ini file. This is
handled using the <a href="ini_manager.html">stlplus::ini_manager</a> component.</p>

<p>Ini files are divided into sections. When importing from an Ini file you
need to specify which section you are importing from. Then, the cli_parser
tests the stlplus::ini_manager to see if any of the options (except for the "" option)
are represented by a variable of the same name in the Ini file. For example,
the "help" option will be represented by a variable called "help" in the Ini
file. If an option is found as a variable, then the value of
that variable is read in as the default value.</p>

<p>Taking the definitions from the last section, and using the application
name "DoIt" as the Ini file section, here's how the default values could have
been represented in an Ini file:</p>

<pre class="script">
[DoIt]
help = off
map = moods.lmf
</pre>

<p>It is possible to cancel a built-in default from an Ini file without
specifying a new value. This is done by simply omitting the value:</p>

<pre class="script">
map =
</pre>

<p>This means that there will be no default value for the "map" option despite
the fact that the built-in definitions provided one.</p>

<p>As with built-in defaults, switch values are switched on by "on", "true" or
"1" and off by "off", "false" and "0". These are case-insensitive. In fact,
any other value is currently regarded as off, but this may change in the
future so the use of one of these three values is recommended.</p>


<h2 id="command_line">Parsing the Command-Line</h2>

<p>Once the cli_parser has been set up with a set of definitions and
optionally has had default values set drom an Ini file, the next stage is to
parse the command-line. This is done by the parse(0 function:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
bool cli_parser::parse(char* argv[]);
</pre>

<p>This takes as its argument the argv vector from main() and parses it. If
the parse succeeds, then the function returns true. If there are eny errors,
they will be reported by the stlplus::message_handler set up in the constructor and then
the parse function will return false.</p>

<p>The parser works like this:</p>

<p>For each argument except argument 0 (the command name), the parser first
determines whether the argument is a value or an option. An option is
indicated by a leading '-'.</p>

<p>If the argument is a value, it is added as a value
to the "" option if there is one. If there is no "" option defined, an error
is reported.</p>

<p>If the argument is an option, then the option is looked up in the set of
definitions. This lookup uses substring matching, so for example the
command-line option "-h" will match the definition for "help". The parser will
pick the first option matching the command-line substring. The search is
carried out in definition order, so the earliest definitions will have shorter
abbreviations. For example, given two definitions "help" and "hello" in that
order, both "-h", "-he" and "-hel" will match with "help" and the shortest
abbreviation for "hello" will be "-hell".</p>

<p>If a command-line option doesn't match any definition using this method,
then it is checked to see if it is prefixed with "-no", since this is how
options are negated. The definitions are searched again for an option without
this prefix, so for example "-noh" will match with "help".</p>

<p>If no option can be found that matches either of these searches, an error
is produced. Otherwise there are three possibilities:</p>

<p>If the definition is a switch kind, then a value is added for that option.
The value will be on if the switch was found in its positive form (e.g. "-h", off if it
was found in its negated form (e.g. "-noh").</p>

<p>If the definition was a value kind and the option was found in its positive
form, then the next argument from argv is read and that becomes the value of
the option. If there are no further arguments, an error is reported.</p>

<p>If the definition was a value kind and was negated, then this cancels all
previous values of the option including ini file defaults and built-in
defaults. This is provided so that users can override defaults from the
command-line. Negated value options do not have a value so the next arguement
in argv is <em>not</em> read.</p>

<p>In all cases the mode determines what happens to any previous values of the
option. If the option is single mode, then all previous values are cancelled.
If the option is a multiple mode, any values from lower levels (i.e. Ini file
or built-in defaults) are cancelled. If the option is cumulative mode, no
previous values are cancelled.</p>


<h2 id="interpreting">Interpreting the Command-Line</h2>

<p>Once the command-line has been successfully parsed, the values read can be
interpreted. The set of values available will be the built-in default values,
plus the Ini-file default values, plus the command-line values, with the
override rules appropriate to the option modes. This gives in effect a
composite command line made up of the concatenation of all these values. The
composite command-line is then read from left to right.</p>

<p>An example is needed to clarify exactly what is in this composite command
line. Take the following definitions:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
stlplus::cli_definitions definitions =
  {
    {"",        stlplus::cli_value_kind,  stlplus::cli_multiple_mode,   "VCOMPILE_USAGE_VALUE",   0},
    {"help",    stlplus::cli_switch_kind, stlplus::cli_single_mode,     "VCOMPILE_USAGE_HELP",    0},
    {"87",      stlplus::cli_switch_kind, stlplus::cli_cumulative_mode, "VCOMPILE_USAGE_87",      "off"},
    END_CLI_DEFINITIONS
  };
</pre>

<p>The only built-in default is for the "87" option, so the initial
command-line options are:</p>

<pre class="script">
-no87
</pre>

<p>Now lets say that the following command-line is typed in by the user:</p>

<pre class="script">
DoIt file1.vhdl -87 file2.vhdl -no87 file3.vhdl
</pre>

<p>Since the "87" option is cumulative, the command-line does not override the
built-in defaults. The result is that the composite options are:</p>

<pre class="script">
-no87 file1.vhdl -87 file2.vhdl -no87 file3.vhdl
</pre>

<p>Thus the composite command line will have a total of 6 options.</p>

<p>Options are processed in a loop using the following access functions:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
unsigned cli_parser::size(void) const;
std::string cli_parser::name(unsigned i) const;
unsigned cli_parser::id(unsigned i) const;
stlplus::cli_kind_t cli_parser::kind(unsigned i) const;
stlplus::cli_mode_t cli_parser::mode(unsigned i) const;
bool cli_parser::switch_value(unsigned i) const throw(stlplus::cli_mode_error);
std::string cli_parser::string_value(unsigned i) const throw(stlplus::cli_mode_error);
</pre>

<p>The size function is used to control the for loop that processes the
command-line. You should follow the normal C convention:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
for (unsigned i = 0; i &lt; parser.size(); i++)
{
  ...
}
</pre>

<p>Note that the count goes from zero, not from one as it would if you were
processing argv.</p>

<p>Options are accessed from left to right by index. The first thing you do
with an option is to get its name (a string) or its ID (an unsigned). The name
is the full name of the option, not the abbreviated name entered by the user.
If you use names, then the body of the loop will be a series of if statements
matching the name of an option with the name of the value:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
for (unsigned i = 0; i &lt; parser.size(); i++)
{
  if (parser.name(i) == "help")
    ...
  else if (parser.name(i) == "87")
    ...
}
</pre>

<p>This is pretty clumsy, but readable. It is sometimes simpler to use IDs instead. Basically,
definitions get numbered when they are added to the parser. They are numbered
from 0 in the order in which they are added. Thus given the following
definitions:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
stlplus::cli_parser::definitions definitions =
  {
    {"",        stlplus::cli_value_kind,  stlplus::cli_parser::multiple_mode,   "VCOMPILE_USAGE_VALUE",   0},
    {"help",    stlplus::cli_switch_kind, stlplus::cli_parser::single_mode,     "VCOMPILE_USAGE_HELP",    0},
    {"87",      stlplus::cli_switch_kind, stlplus::cli_parser::cumulative_mode, "VCOMPILE_USAGE_87",      "off"},
    END_CLI_DEFINITIONS
  };
</pre>

<p>Option "" is ID 0, option "help" is ID 1, and so on. Using IDs allows a
switch statement to be used instead of a series of if statements:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
for (unsigned i = 0; i &lt; parser.size(); i++)
{
  switch (parser.id(i))
  {
  case 0:
    ...
    break;
  case 1:
    ...
    break;
  ...
  }
}
</pre>

<p>There are two methods for getting values depending on the kind of an option. Switch kinds should
be read using cli_parser::switch_value() whilst value kind options should be read using
cli_parser::string_value(). If you use the wrong function, the exception stlplus::cli_mode_error
will be thrown. The switch_value() method returns a bool indicating whether the switch was on (true)
or off (false), whilst the string_value() function returns the value of that option as a
std::string. Note that the command line values will appear as value mode options with the name ""
(or in the example above, ID 0).


<h2 id="usage">Usage Reports</h2>

<p>The parser can produce usage reports, for example if the parse fails and
you want to report this to the user, or for the "help" option. The usage
report is produced by the usage() function:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
void cli_parser::usage(void) const;
</pre>

<p>The usage report is produced using the stlplus::message_handler set up in the
constructor and uses the message mnemonics set up in the definitions. It also
reports the options that have been set and their origin (for example, built-in
default or Ini file. For example:</p>

<pre class="terminal">
usage: vcompile { arguments }
arguments:
    &lt;file&gt;                  # one or more files to compile
    -[no]help               # this help!
    -map &lt;path&gt;             # set the library mapping file (.lmf) to use - default is ./moods.lmf
    -errors &lt;number&gt;        # set the error limit to &lt;number&gt; - default 10
    -work &lt;name&gt;            # make &lt;name&gt; the current work library
    -[no]87                 # VHDL'87 compatibility mode - when off files are compiled in VHDL'93
values:
    -map moods.lmf : from builtin default
    -errors 10 : from builtin default
    -no87 : from builtin default
    -help : from command line
</pre>


<h2 id="exceptions">Exceptions thrown</h2>

<p>The CLI parser defines three exceptions that can be thrown. All of these
are defined as subclasses of std::logic_error as described in the STLplus
<a href="exceptions.html">exceptions philosophy</a>. This means that
exceptions will only occur due to programming errors - that is, if you use the
CLI parser incorrectly in your program. User errors can never cause an
exception.</p>

<p>The following exceptions are defined:</p>

<dl>

<dt>stlplus::cli_mode_error</dt>

<dd>Subclass of std::invalid_argument. Thrown if a command-line argument is accessed with the wrong mode - i.e. attempt to get the value of a switch</dd>

<dt>stlplus::cli_index_error</dt>

<dd>Subclass of to std::out_of_range. Thrown for using an index out of range</dd>

<dt>stlplus::cli_argument_error</dt>

<dd>Subclass of std::invalid_argument. Thrown for passing an illegal argument to a method</dd>

</dl>


<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>

<p>Here's the CLI parser part of the source code for a command-line library manager called vlibrary.</p>

<pre class="cpp">
#include "cli_parser.hpp"
#include "file_system.hpp"
#include &lt;string&gt;

int main (int argc, char* argv[])
{
  // work out where the program is installed on the system

  // this program requires that the software is designed with the following
  // directory structure:
  //   &lt;top&gt;
  //     +-bin
  //     |  +- vlibrary.exe    // executable
  //     +-config
  //        +- vlibrary.ini    // Configuration (Ini) file - see stlplus::ini_manager.hpp
  //        +- messages.txt    // Text of all error messages - see stlplus::message_handler.hpp

  // the install_path function returns the folder containing the executable so
  // the root folder is one up from that
  std::string root = stlplus::folder_up(stlplus::install_path(argv[0]));

  // set up an error handler with the one message file
  // first initialise so that messages go to standard error, there's an error
  // limit of 0 (infinite)
  stlplus::message_handler messages(std::cerr, 0);
  // now add the message file
  messages.add_message_file(stlplus::create_filespec(stlplus::folder_down(root,"config"),"messages.txt"));

  // set up an Ini file manager
  // This sets up three files - one in the current directory, one in the HOME
  // directory and one in the installation
  stlplus::ini_manager ini_files;
  ini_files.add_file("vlibrary.ini");
  ini_files.add_file(create_filespec(folder_home(),"vlibrary.ini"));
  ini_files.add_file(create_filespec(folder_down(root,"config"),"vlibrary.ini"));

  // set up the definitions for the command-line options. Note the
  // permutations of switch/value and single/multiple settings.
  stlplus::stlplus::cli_definitions_t definitions =
    {
      {"help",    stlplus::cli_switch_kind, stlplus::cli_single_mode,   "VLIBRARY_USAGE_HELP",    0},
      {"create",  stlplus::cli_value_kind,  stlplus::cli_multiple_mode, "VLIBRARY_USAGE_CREATE",  0},
      {"version", stlplus::cli_switch_kind, stlplus::cli_single_mode,   "VLIBRARY_USAGE_VERSION", "on"},
      END_CLI_DEFINITIONS
    };

  // construct the parser, loading the definitions, the default values from
  // the Ini files and using the error handler for parser errors
  stlplus::cli_parser parser(definitions, ini_files, "vlibrary", messages);

  // now parse the command line which builds the command-line data structure
  // within the parser - if there are any errors, end now
  if (!parser.parse(argv))
  {
    parser.usage();
    return -1;
  }

  // now loop through the parsed command extracting the values
  for (unsigned i = 0; i &amp;lt; parser.size(); i++)
  {
    if (parser.name(i) == "help")
    {

      // This demonstrates how to handle a switch-mode argument. First, detect
      // that the option has been specified by testing the name of the option
      // with if (parser.name(i) == "help"). Then, detect the polarity
      // (off/on) of the switch with if (parser.switch_value(i))
      if (parser.switch_value(i))
      {
        // report the command options using the built-in usage() function
        parser.usage();
      }
    }
    else if (parser.name(i) == "create")
    {
      // create a new library 

      // This demonstrates how to handle a value-mode argument. First, detect
      // that the option has been specified as with the above switch-mode
      // argument, then get the value of the option with &lt;tt&gt;string path =
      // parser.string_value(i);
      std::string library = parser.string_value(i);

      // code removed - not relevant to this example
    }
    else if (parser.name(i) == "version")
    {
      if (parser.switch_value(i))
      {
        // report the version of the program - use the error handler directly
        messages.information("VLIBRARY_VERSION", "1.2");
      }
    }
  }
  return messages.error_count();
}
</pre>

<p>In order to work correctly, the message file would need message definitions for the STLplus
internal messages plus all the messages specific to the vlibrary command. So, given the example
above, the message file would look like this:</p>

<pre>
# messages required by the CLI parser (taken from stlplus/messages/stlplus_messages.txt)
CLI_VALUE_MISSING                option @0 requires a value - end of line was reached instead

CLI_NO_VALUES                    argument @0 is invalid - this program doesn't take command-line arguments
CLI_USAGE_PROGRAM                usage:\n\t@0 { arguments }
