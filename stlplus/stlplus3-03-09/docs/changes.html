<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>This section is an attempt to document all the changes made to the STLplus library.
However, the change log has been restarted for version 3 of the library since the changes
for this version are huge. Therefore only the changes since then have been documented.</p>

<p>The official open-source version of STLplus starts at version 2.0 and you can access the change
log for all version 2 releases by looking at the 
<a href="http://stlplus.sourceforge.net/stlplus/docs/changes.html">version 2 documentation</a>.</p>

<h2 id="v3.8">Changes from Version 3.7 to 3.8</h2>

<h3>Fixed bug in digraph relating to the removal of the first/last node or arc</h3>

<p>A user (dark_knight_ita) reported a bug in digraph whereby removing the first or last node or arc left the internal pointers pointing at deleted memory.</p>

<p>This has been corrected by a patch also provided by the user.</p>

<h3>Make containers/simple_ptr and containers/smart-ptr double-destruct-proof</h3>

<p>DJDM reported a situation in which a simple_ptr had been
double-destructed, causing a crash. OK, double-destruction should
never happen anyway, but it is also simple to make these pointer
classes proof against this as well.</p>

<p>DJDM contributed the double-destruct proofing of simple_ptr and I
(AJR) adapted this for smart_ptr. This code only deals with avoiding
double-destruction issues, it does not allow method-based access of a
destroyed object.</p>

<h3>Re-added a bug fix to containers/ntree</h3>

<p>The ntree::cut method had a bug where the old method name
  set_new_owner was used when the renamed method change_owner should
  have been used. This bug was fixed in v3.6 but seems to have crept
  back in, possibly in the rework of ntree which was done for v3.7. So
  I've fixed it again.</p>

<h2 id="v3.7">Changes from Version 3.6 to 3.7</h2>

<h3>Rework of simple_ptr type conversion methods to work with gcc</h3>

<p>Contributed by DJDM.</p>

<p>GCC is a little more rigid with it's types
when it comes to using derivative template types being returned from
template functions of a template. It is also a bit more rigid when it
comes to accessing the private members of one instance of a template
from another instance.</p>

<h3>Moved Project Files to Separate /ide Directory</h3>

<p>The project files for various IDEs are multiplying. So to manage
  these files better, I have created a separate top-level directory to
  contain them. There is a separate sub-directory for each supported
  IDE.</p>

<p>At present the following IDEs are supported:</p>

<dl>

<dt>bcb6</dt>
<dd>Borland C++ Builder v6 (a.k.a. Embarcadero RAD Suite v8)</dd>

<dt>vs2010</dt>
<dd>Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 (v10)</dd>

<dt>vs6</dt>
<dd>Microsoft Visual Studio v6 - A baseline from which other versions
  can be supported</dd>

</dl>

<p>There is a project file for building STLplus as 5 separate
  libraries and another for building the single monolithic library.</p>

<p>The <strong>gcc</strong> make system has not been changed and the Makefiles are
  still local to each folder in the build. This works better in my
  opinion for command-line make.</p>

<h3>Added persistence and print/to_string to the STL shared_ptr</h3>

<p>There is now support in the persistence library and in the strings
  library for the std::shared_ptr class. This is only supported if it
  is a true c++0x version of shared_ptr - that is, it is in the std::
  namespace.</p>

<p>I don't support std::tr1::shared_ptr nor boost::shared_ptr.</p>

<p>In Visual Studio 2010, std::shared_ptr is available as
  standard.</p>

<p>In gcc version 4.5 (I'm not sure the earliest version), it is
  enabled by the gcc option -std=c++0x or by running make as:</p>

<pre>
make CXXFLAGS=-std=c++0x
</pre>

<p>In Borland (Embarcadero) C++ Builder, std::shared_ptr is not available.</p>

<p>In order to support this, I've made internal changes to the
  persistence context classes and to the implementation of persistence
  for smart_ptr, simple_ptr, digraph and ntree. However, these have no
  impact on user code and there is no change in the persistence file
  format.</p>

<h3>docs/persistent_examples.html</h3>

<p>Added downloadable code for some of the persistence examples.</p>

<h3>strings/print_pair.tpp and strings/print_map.tpp: Bug fixes</h3>

<p>A couple of bugs fixed related to the conversion from STLplus
  2. These only showed when trying to compile a program that uses
  these functions.</p>

<h3>portability/ip_sockets.cpp: Visual Studio 10 fixes</h3>

<p>Visual Studio now defines constants such as EINPROGRESS so I no
  longer need to define these. However, I still define them
  for older versions of Visual Studio.</p>

<h3>portability/file_system.cpp: Clarified definition of file and folder</h3>

<p>The functions for differentiating between a file and a folder did
  not handle 'other' filesystem objects correctly. I have now defined
  a file to be a regular file (any OS), symbolic link (Unix only), socket (Unix
  only) or named pipe (any OS). A folder is defined as just a
  directory (any OS). Character devices (any OS) and block devices (Unix only) are
  neither files nor folders.</p>

<h3>Makefile: fixed path problems</h3>

<p>Two makefiles source/Makefile and tests/Makefile, relied on the
  current directory ('.') being on the path, which for me it always
  is. However, this caused make to fail for other users. The makefiles
  have been fixed so they do not rely on this.</p>

<h2 id="v3.6">Changes from Version 3.5 to 3.6</h2>

<h3>Switched to Visual Studio 10 (2010)</h3>

<p>Visual Studio 10 Express Edition is now the preferred offering from
  Microsoft. Converting the solution and project files from Visual Studio 9
  overwrote them, so now there are only Visual Studio 10 solutions and
  projects.</p>

<p>In principle I could rename these to support both simultaneously,
  but I will wait and see if there is a demand before investing the
  time and effort to do so.</p>

<h3>Made internals of subprocess and async_subprocess protected</h3>

<p>These fields were private so that derived classes couldn't access
  them. This was orignally chosen to hide the platform-specific nature
  of the internals. However, there are occasions when a subclass needs
  to access these fields, so they are now protected.</p>

<p>Change requested/contributed by DJDM.</p>

<h3>Bug Fix - Declaration of environ incorrect for NetBSD</h3>

<p>On some platforms the external variable environ has to be declared
  before use. The declaration was accidentally moved inside the
  stlplus namespace. This doesn't show as a problem on other platforms
  because they supply system declarations of this variable. However,
  on NetBSD the system declaration is missing and this shows up the
  scoping problem.</p>

<p>The problem has been solved by simply moving the external
  declaration back into global scope where it belongs.</p>

<h3>Bug Fix - Crash in portability/ip_sockets due to signals on Linux</h3>

<p>Bug fix contributed by DJDM</p>

<p>On linux, occasionally, if a socket disconnects remotely between
  the points at which you ask for send_ready and actually doing the
  send, then the send will fail, but also on Linux sends the SIGPIPE
  signal, which kills the program if it is unhandled - most of the
  time. As the return of -1 is all you need from the send function,
  it's best to set it not to generate the SIGPIPE in the first place,
  which is done by adding the MSG_NOSIGNAL flag to the send calls.</p>

<h3>Tidy-up of portability/build Reporting</h3>

<p>You can use the portability/build functions to report which version
  of compiler and build options were used to build STLplus. I've
  tidied this up and provided more functions to get parts of the
  build string.</p>

<h3>Bug Fix - Crash in portability/file_system</h3>

<p>The getcwd function returns the C-string path to the current
  directory. This is then used to construct a std::string. However,
  getcwd can very rarely return a null pointer, which crashes the
  std::string constructor. I've fixed the code so that a null return
  value is converted into an empty string.</p>

<h3>Minor Tidy-up of portability/subprocesses</h3>

<p>Some of the error handling was inconsistently handled in the
  subprocess classes, so I've worked through systematically adding
  error handling in a consistent way.</p>

<p>I've also added get_variables methods to the subprocess classes so
  you can examine the environment of the subprocess.</p>

<h3>Added &lt; operator to containers/foursome and containers/triple</h3>

<p>Fix contributed by DJDM</p>

<p>Having operator&lt; allows these classes to be used in maps and
sets. They are defined in terms of the operator&lt; <i>only</i> for
each of the contained types.</p>

<h3>Rework of containers/ntree</h3>

<p>The ntree container was lacking a set of methods for building trees
  out of other trees without copying the contents. This is
  inefficient. I have added a set of move methods which move the
  argument tree into the target tree, destroying the argument tree in
  the process. These complement the insert methods that add subtrees
  in the same way, but copy them first.</p>

<p>In the process, I've deprecated the append method in favour of an
  insert or move with no offset, which defaults to the append
  functionality.</p>

<h2 id="v3.5">Changes from Version 3.4 to 3.5</h2>

<h3>Added monolithic build option</h3>

<p>You can now merge the libraries together into one large library - known as a monolithic build of
STLplus. The simplest way of doing this is to use a shell - DOS shell on Windows, bash shell on
Linux or other Unix - and cd to the <code>stlplus3/source</code> directory. There, run the script
<code>make_monolithic</code>. This copies all of the source code into the directory. Then you will
find there are alternative project files and build scripts in the source directory to allow you to
use STLplus as a monolithic library.</p>

<h3>Re-added simple_ptr</h3>

<p>The simple_ptr variants of the smart_ptr classes were originally in v2 of STLplus but were not
added to v3 because I was unsure whether to have two different ways of doing the same thing
(something I do not generally agree with). However, the author (Dan Milton) has convinced me that
they should be in the library because they are sufficiently different from smart_ptr.</p>

<p>The simple_ptr classes have been rewritten in the same style as smart_ptr and share the same set
of copy functors to implement the copy/clone/nocopy semantics. To achieve this, the copy functors
have been factored out into the header copy_functors.hpp.</p>

<p>Support functions for simple_ptr classes have been added to the persistence and strings libraries.</p>

<h3>Reduced the number of disabled warnings for the Borland compiler</h3>

<p>It has been reported that some of the pragmas in, for example containers_fixes.hpp which disable
warnings in Borland compilers are now unnecessary. I have reduced this to a set of two:</p>

<dl>
<dt>8026</dt><dd>Functions with exception specifications are not expanded inline</dd>
<dt>8027</dt><dd>Functions with xxx are not expanded inline</dd>
</dl>

<p>These fit into the category of warnings you cannot get rid of which erroneously suggest there is
a problem in STLplus when the problem is in the compiler. I dislike such warnings which raise false
alarms, so they will remain disabled.</p>

<h3>Added hash::erase(iterator)</h3>

<p>This method, which allows a hash element to be erased via its iterator, has been added for
compatibility with std::map.</p>

<h3>Re-added hash::debug_report()</h3>

<p>This function was present in STLplus v2, but was removed temporarily due to the removal of TextIO
from STLplus. The intention was to re-add it soon after by porting the function to use IOStreams,
but it got forgotten in the changeover. It has now been re-added, ported to IOStreams.</p>

<h3>Fixed bug in smart_ptr</h3>

<p>There was a bug reported in smart_ptr whereby a gcc-compiled application would crash due to a
missing assignment operator in the baseclass smart_ptr_base. This bug was introduced in smart_ptr's
redesign for STLplus v3.0 when the common base class was introduced.</p>

<h3>Rework of Internet Sockets</h3>

<p>Previous versions of STLplus had an object-oriented interface to TCP sockets, that is sockets
which have been configured for TCP communications. This subsystem (part of portability) has been
redesigned to provide three subsystems:</p>

<dl>
<dt>ip_sockets.hpp</dt>
<dd>This is a low-level subsystem that provides an object-orientated and platform independent
interface to IP (Internet Protocol) sockets. It hides the ugly C interface of sockets and the
platform-specifics. However, it is not really intended to be used directly (though it can), so it is
not documented separately. Instead it is the base class for the TCP and UDP interfaces.</dd>
<dt>tcp_sockets.hpp</dt>
<dd>This is the TCP sockets interface that used to be part of STLplus, completely rewritten to use
the ip_sockets layer but providing the same interface as before.</dd>
<dt>udp_sockets.hpp</dt>
<dd>This is a new interface to UDP sockets. UDP is a simpler, faster protocol to TCP and is used for
many streaming applications. It is implemented using the ip_sockets layer.</dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="v3.4">Changes from Version 3.3 to 3.4</h2>

<h3>Change in terminology</h3>

<p>The ntree is a tree data structure where each node can have any number of children. This is
technically not an n-ary tree as I thought when I wrote it. An n-ary tree has <em>exactly</em> n
children on each node, whereas my ntree class can have any number of children. Furthermore, trees
can be classed as rooted or unrooted depending on whether it has a single root node. So the
documentation now refers to it as a rooted tree. That is, it is an arbitrary-branched tree with a
single root node.</p>

<p>The code has not changed - in particular the class is still called ntree - because I don't see
the point in breaking existing code over a slight terminology mix-up.</p>

<h3>Fixes for gcc v4.3</h3>

<p>As has happened several times in the past, a new version of gcc has tighter rules than older
versions and caused some minor problems in the code to be revealed. There are two types: (1) use of C++
features that were common practice when STLplus was originally developed, but which have been
deprecated; (2) missing system includes, since some system files used to be implicitly included.</p>

<p>Both STLplus v3.4 and all the tests now compile correctly with gcc v4.3 as well as older versions.</p>

<h3>Porting to Borland Compilers</h3>

<p>The old STLplus v2 was ported to Borland v5.5 by a user. However, STLplus
v3 has never been ported.</p>

<p>The libraries have been modified to support both the v5.5 compiler (the
Free Command-line Tools) and the v5.8 compiler (Turbo C++ 2006 Explorer).</p>

<p>This has required the following changes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Elimination of the use of 'typename' temporaries (i.e. names of types
declared in template classes) in expressions - v5.5 only supports
typenames in declarations</li>
<li>Support for the typename keyword in v5.8 but not v5.5</li>
<li>Suppression of more warnings</li>
<li>Rewriting 'ttt xxx = *this' as 'ttt xxx(*this) because old compilers such
as v5.5 interpret assignment of *this to mean overriding of memory management</li>
<li>Reworked element access of bitset - use xxx.test(i) not xxx[i] which is broken in v5.5</li>
<li>Expanded print_smart_ptr and smart_ptr_to_string into three template
functions each because v5.5 could not resolve the function when the function
parameter was a basetype of the actual parameter</li>
<li>Extra #includes to system headers which other compilers resolve implicitly</li>
<li>Work-around bug in v5.5's implementation of std::string which stops a copy
at a null termination (incorrect) rather than using the size parameter
(correct). This broke stlplus::inf which uses std::string as a binary byte
store which therefore must be able to contain zeros</li>
<li>Fixed bug in library manager where operator&lt;&lt;'s body was in global scope.
It would appear that other compilers fix this problem implicitly</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="v3.3">Changes from Version 3.2 to 3.3</h2>

<p>The purpose of this release is to change the status from beta to stable. There are no code
changes and the only difference is a correction in the copyright notice.</p>

<h3>Fixed Copyright statement</h3>

<p>The copyright statement now gives credit to Southampton University, UK, who initially funded my
work on this project and therefore have part-ownership of the STLplus project. The copyright
statement now reads:</p>

<pre>

<h2 id="v3.2">Changes from Version 3.1 to 3.2</h2>

<h3>Added dynaload class to portability library</h3>

<p>This class is a platform-independent and object-oriented interface to the dynamic library loader
functions.</p>

<h3>Softened dependencies on the portability library</h3>

<p>I have modified the persistence and strings libraries so that the dependency on the portability
library is soft not hard. This means that both libraries can be compiled without the portability library if
you don't want persistence or printing support for the portability/inf type.</p>

<h3>Made the Containers Library an 'Include-only' Library</h3>

<p>The containers library had only one component that needed compiling - the rest of the library is
template code that gets included in your code. I have inlined the one component (the exception
classes) so that the library is entirely headers and does not need compiling.</p>

<p>This change also required changes to the makefiles project, so if you are using my makefiles you
will need to download the latest version of that too (i.e. at least v1.4).</p>

<h3>Use ANSI-Specific Functions on Windows</h3>

<p>The STLplus library does not support Unicode (for good reasons - the wide string class is too
weakly defined to have a common cross-platform interpretation). However, it should be usable in
a system that does. I have modified the Windows system calls to always call the ANSI variants and use
narrow strings even when compiled with the UNICODE macro enabled.</p>

<h3>File Mode Function Removed</h3>

<p>The function file_set_mode has been removed because it is non-portable and there's no way to make
it portable. It was legacy code from a Unix-only project and didn't work on Windows. For the time
being, use the platform specific functions for this. In the future I may re-introduce a limited
functionality interface to the file modes once I can work out the common subset.</p>

<h2 id="v3.1">Changes from Version 3.0 to 3.1</h2>

<h3>Bug in subsystems/cli_parser</h3>

<p>The macro END_CLI_DEFINITIONS contained an error with namespaces - so it would only work if you
were "using namespace stlplus". This should now work when using the stlplus:: prefix notation as
well.</p>

<h3>Bug in subsystems/cli_parser</h3>

<p>There was a bug related to the use of a definition_t to define a command-line argument. The bug
caused the cli_parser to crash with a segmentation fault due to a null pointer being passed to a
std::string.</p>

<h3>Built-in messages in subsystems/message_handler</h3>

<p>The minimum set of messages (for the cli_handler) has now been built-in to the message_handler so
that applications can more easily be built with no message-file handling.</p>

<h3>Bug in Windows port of quoted command-line arguments in portability/subprocesses.</h3>

<p>This bug resulted in a quoted string being converted by the argument_vector class into a
doubled-up string - i.e. "./fred" would get converted into "..//ffrreedd". The bug only manifested
on Windows.</p>

<h3>Change to kill semantics in portability/subprocesses</h3>

<p>A bug fix was submitted by Alistair Low to enable the subprocess classes to kill a whole
subprocess tree rather than just the parent process. I have yet to confirm whether this is the
behaviour of the Unix port - it should be.</p>

<h3>Bug in portability/debug</h3>

<p>One of the macros in the debug header had a typo - which broke the debug utilities. The symptom
was in DEBUG_TRACE which would result in a compilation error due to a reference to the undefined
class stlplus_debug_trace. This has been fixed.</p>

<h3>Change to implementation of portability/debug</h3>

<p>The string formatting was being done by string-stream classes. I have
rewritten it to use the more efficient portability/dprintf.</p>

<h3>Changes to subsystems/cli_parser use of subsystems/ini_manager</h3>

<p>The CLI Parser loads default values from the Ini Manager. However, in
previous versions, it was possible for a typo to mean that an option was
ignored. I have now added error checking so that all variables in the relevant
section of the Ini Manager are recognised as command-line options.</p>

<p>An extra error message has been added to messages/stlplus_messages.txt to
report this error.</p>

<h3>Changes to subsystems/ini_manager to improve error reporting</h3>

<p>The Ini Manager now keeps track of which line in the Ini file a value comes
from, so that error reporting can report the file name and line number of an
error. The method ini_manager::variable_linenumber has been added for this
purpose.</p>

<h3>Bug Fix in portability/subprocesses</h3>

<p>There was a bug in the quoting code for Windows command-lines which
resulted in quote marks being added after every character in a string that
needed quoting (i.e. contained special characters). This has been fixed.</p>

<h2 id="v3.0">Changes from Version 2 to 3.0</h2>

<h3>Split the library into a Collection</h3>

<p>The original STLplus was a single, rather large, library. It has now been split into 5 libraries.
So STLplus is now referred to as a Library Collection, containing within it the STLplus <a
href="containers.html">containers</a>, <a href="portability.html">portability</a>, <a
href="persistence.html">persistence</a>, <a href="subsystems.html">subsystems</a> and <a
href="strings.html">strings</a> libraries.</p>

<h3>Added the stlplus Namespace</h3>

<p>All of the components in the STLplus library collection now have their own namespace - stlplus.
Thus, the smart_ptr class is now stlplus::smart_ptr.</p>

<h3>Removed TextIO</h3>

<p>STLplus had it's own I/O subsystem for historical reasons. That was OK when I was the only user,
but a bit much for new users to be expected to accept. I decided that TextIO had to go, but needed
to wait for other major changes to justify a change that makes the library not backwards
compatible.</p>

<p>STLplus version 3 does not have the TextIO subsystem any more - all functions using TextIO have
been rewritten to use IOStream.</p>

<h3>Removed string_arithmetic</h3>

<p>The string_arithmetic package was an anachronism - it was part of another project which seemed
suitable for inclusion into STLplus, but now seems not to fit. So I have removed it.</p>

<h3>Renamed error_handler to message_handler</h3>

<p>The old name error_handler I think confused people as to the purpose of this component. Since
STLplus 3 is not compatible with previous versions, I am taking this opportunity to rename it to
better reflect its purpose - <a href="message_handler.html">message_handler</a>.</p>

<h3>Safe Iterators</h3>

<p>Iterators in the STL are badly designed - there are several major pitfalls with using them as a
result of their design. However, I wanted STLplus to feel like the STL to make it easier to use, so
felt I should use the iterator concept despite the problems associated with them. Some of the
STLplus components therefore also use iterators.</p>

<p>In STLplus 2 I included some error checking for misuse of iterators. In STLplus 3 I have
completed the job - so I have termed the STLplus iterators <a href="safe_iterator.html">safe
iterators</a>.</p>

<h3>Changed Interfaces to enable Namespace Support</h3>

<p>The old STLplus used a technique for writing template functions that required external resources
to be in the global namespace. This approach is not compatible with placing all of the STLplus into
a separate namespace. All these functions have been rewritten to take an extra parameter so
that those external resources are now passed as parameters.</p>

<p>This rewrite applies to the <a href="persistence.html">persistence</a> library and the <a
href="strings.html">strings</a> library.</p>

<h3>Persistence Functions Renamed</h3>

<p>STLplus 2 relied on overloading the functions dump and restore to implement persistence. However,
because of the redesign of the functions discussed above, persistence functions are now passed as
parameters to other persistence functions. To avoid ambiguity, all persistence functions now have
unique names - dump_<em>type</em> and restore_<em>type</em>. See the <a
href="persistence.html">persistence library</a> for more information.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> the persistence file format is unchanged by this rewrite, so STLplus version 2 files
can be read by version 3 and vice versa.</p>

<h3>Print and String-Conversion Functions Renamed</h3>

<p>STLplus 2 string_utilities also relied on overloading the functions print and to_string to
provide printing and formatting functions for whole data structures. However, because of the
redesign of the functions discussed above, functions are now passed as parameters to other
functions. To avoid ambiguity, all print and string-formatting functions now have unique names -
print_<em>type</em> and <em>type</em>_to_string. See the <a href="strings.html">strings library</a> for
more information.</p>
