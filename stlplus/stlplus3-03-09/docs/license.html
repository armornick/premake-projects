<h2 id="intent">The Intent of this License</h2>

<p>This section explains my intent in having a license agreement for this software.</p>

<p>I have chosen to use the <a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php">BSD
license</a> as my template. This is approximately equivalent to the
<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">Creative Commons "Attribution"</a> license.
I like this because it achieves my aims simply and reasonable briefly.
It is easy to understand and contains no traps for the unwary.</p>

<p>I have two aims in having a license agreement for the STLplus library. I wish to protect myself
from (1) intellectual property thieves and (2) litiginous idiots.</p>

<p>To achieve the first aim, the STLplus library is copyrighted software. Basically I have utter
contempt for people who steal other people's creative works and either use it unacknowledged or
claim it as their own. So I'm asserting my right to be identified as the author of the original
work. You can use, modify and distribute copies of the library provided that it keeps the copyright
and license statements. This copyright also protects authors of additions, bug-fixes and other
contributions to the library. You can add your own copyright statements for your own contributions
to a modified version of the library.</p>

<p>To achieve the second aim, I have included a disclaimer in the license. Basically software is too
complex to guarantee and the majority of software is therefore provided on a best-endeavours, as-is
policy. Sadly some people, especially those in the legal profession, don't seem to understand this.
So the disclaimer states categorically that you use this software entirely at your own risk. For
example, if your product crashes because of a bug in the STLplus library, it is 100% your fault for
not testing the product fully. If you use the library then you are implicitly agreeing to these
terms. If you don't like that, don't use the STLplus library. Or the STL library, or the C run-time,
or any part of the operating system for that matter.</p>

<p>That's it really. I don't subscribe to the idealism of some open-source advocates who claim that
open-source software should only be available to other open-source developers. I want this library
to be used by anyone and everyone, well except intellectual property thieves and litiginous idiots.
There are therefore no restrictions saying you have to make your products open source as well
because I don't believe in that. If you wish to use this library in an open source project, great.
If you wish to use it in a closed-source commercial product, equally great.</p>

<p>I have tried two other licenses before this one. I started with the <a
href="http://opensource.org/licenses/gpl-license.php">Gnu Public License (GPL)</a> but it was far
too restrictive for use with a software library in that it forced all derivative works to be GPLed
as well. This made the STLplus library unavailable for commercial developers. I then switched to the
<a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/lgpl-license.php">Lesser (or Library) Gnu Public License
(LGPL)</a> which is supposedly aimed at libraries. However, a user pointed out that this also forced
derivative works to be LGPLed unless STLplus was provided as a dynamically linked library, and I
know from experience that dynamic linking is painful on many platforms, is a deterrent to library
use so contrary to my aims and furthermore is useless anyway for a C++ library since
template code gets inlined.</p>

<h2 id="compliance">How to Comply with this License</h2>

<p>The above license is all very well, but what does it mean?</p>

<ul>

<li>You can distribute the STLplus library as source code, in which case the original license and
copyright must be kept. That means the license comments in the source code and this web page must be
part of the distribution.</li>

<li>You can distribute a modified STLplus library as source code, in which case you can claim
authorship of your modifications, but must include the original license and copyright for the
original STLplus software as above.</li>

<li>You can incorporate the STLplus library in an application or other object library by simply
linking it, in which case you should include a credit to the STLplus library in the documentation
and/or a credits dialog in the software itself. It would be appreciated if this credit included the
URL of the STLplus website: <a href="http://stlplus.sourceforge.net/">http://stlplus.sourceforge.net/</a>.</li>

</ul>

<h2 id="history">Historical Note</h2>

<p>Development of this software started whilst I was employed as a Research Fellow by Southampton
University, UK, in April 1999. Components were added to the library as I needed them for a major
development project I was working on at the time - a VHDL compiler for a behavioural synthesis system
called MOODS. I continued development (of the compiler and the library) whilst working for LME - a
University spin-off company - from September 1999 until October 2001. Most of the basic development
of the compiler and STLplus was completed by then. When LME went bust that October, I resumed
working at the University. The STLplus library was released as an open source library on
SourceForge with permission from the University in December 2003. I left the University in June
2004. I have been maintaining and bug-fixing the library since then as a personal project, using it
in other software projects. In 2007 I embarked on a major redesign to make the library more
up-to-date in terms of its exploitation of C++ features as well as splitting it into a library
collection for the version 3 release.</p>

<p>I claim copyright of the software from 2004 onwards on two counts: as the primary developer both before public
release and after; as the person responsible for maintaining the software and protecting its
copyright on behalf of myself and the University. Southampton University clearly has residual
rights to the software, since it paid for the initial development from 1999-2004.</p>
