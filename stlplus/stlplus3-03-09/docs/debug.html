<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>This component contains a set of macros which provide optional debug
code. The debug code is optional in the sense that it can be entirely stripped
out when compiling a release version of software. It is also optional in that a
program compiled for debugging will still not produce any debug output unless it
is switched on through the environment.</p>


<h2 id="control">Control</h2>

<p>All of the debug macros are controlled by the compiler directive NDEBUG. This
is the same compiler directive that is used by the standard C &lt;assert.h&gt;. This
compiler directive removes all debug code when the directive is present, but
keeps it when it is absent. Typically, release versions of software will be
compiled with NDEBUG defined so that all debug code, including assertions, are
stripped out of the source.</p>

<p>The compilation utilities used by us (either Make files or VC++) set NDEBUG
when compiling with release options but unset it when compiling in any other
mode.</p>

<p>Programs containing debugging code can have the debug option switched on via
the environment variable DEBUG which takes as its value the name of the source
file for which debugging is to be switched on. Debug code is executed for all
functions in that file plus recursively all functions called from that file (to
any call depth). Put another way, once debug is on at a certain level of call
stack, it stays on for all levels deeper than that to any depth of
recursion. Setting DEBUG to the file containing main() switches debugging on for
the whole program.</p>

<p>In other words, to switch debug options on in shell, type:</p>

<pre class="script">
export DEBUG=main.cpp
</pre>

<p>In MS-DOS:</p>

<pre class="script">
set DEBUG=main.cpp
</pre>

<p>If the variable DEBUG is present, but with an empty string as its value, this
swiches on debugging for the whole program. This is a shortcut for switching on
debug for main.</p>

<p>In other words, to switch debug options on for the whole program in shell, type:</p>

<pre class="script">
export DEBUG=''
</pre>

<p>In MS-DOS:</p>

<pre class="script">
set DEBUG=""
</pre>

<p>To reduce the amount of debugging information, debug mode can be switched on
for just one file. This is done by defining a variable called DEBUG_LOCAL. This
only has to be present - the value is ignored. If DEBUG_LOCAL is present, the
recursive nature of the debug macros is switched off so that only reports from
the one specified file will be seen.</p>

<p>In other words, to switch debug options on for just file main.cpp in shell, type:</p>

<pre class="script">
export DEBUG=main.cpp
export DEBUG_LOCAL=''
</pre>

<p>In MS-DOS:</p>

<pre class="script">
set DEBUG=main.cpp
set DEBUG_LOCAL=""
</pre>


<h2 id="assert">Better Assertions</h2>

<p>The debug utilities header provides an assertion that is meant to be a
complete replacement for the C macro assert(expr). Assertions are used in C
and C++ code for two purposes: to test preconditions for successful
functioning of the program are met and to communicate to a programmer reading
the code that these are tests for preconditions which have no side-effects and
are not part of the behaviour of the code. Assertions should only be used to
detect programming errors that are unrecoverable. User errors should never be
handled this way. Nevertheless it is good practice to assert every assumption
that you make in your code. There is no overhead in that the assertions are
only present in a debug build of the program. Release builds have all the
assertions removed. This is done in any properly set-up development system by
defining the macro NDEBUG for release builds. This causes all debug code to be
removed, including assertions.</p>

<p>The improved assert macro is called DEBUG_ASSERT:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
DEBUG_ASSERT(expression);
</pre>

<p>Statement Macro: If the expression evaluates to true, everything is fine
and nothing happens. If the expression evaluates to false however, it
indicates that there is an error. The file name, line number and function name
are printed along with the expression that failed. The main difference is that
the macro then throws an exception (C++ style) whereas the predefined
assert(expression) macro calls abort() (which is archaic C style). The
exception thrown is called assert_failed. It is a subclass of std::logic_error
(see the STLplus <a href="exceptions.html">exceptions policy</a>).</p>


<h2 id="macros">The Macros</h2>

<pre class="cpp">
DEBUG_TRACE;
</pre>

<p>Statement Macro: Function calls can be traced at run time if a DEBUG_TRACE macro
call is placed at the start of each function. Tracing is switched on for the
function if it is either on alrady from the calling function or the name of the
source file matches the DEBUG environment variable. This results in a message printed out on
standard error as the function is entered (or at least when the macro is
reached). A closing message is sent when the function is exited. Thus you get a
constant stream of function trace information. </p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The other debug macros can only be used in functions containing the
DEBUG_TRACE macro.</p>

<pre class="cpp">
IF_DEBUG(statements);
</pre>

<p>Statement Macro: Will execute the statements if debug is on in this function, otherwise
ignores them. The statements in the macro argument can be any C/C++ statements
but will usually be some kind of print statement. For example:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
IF_DEBUG(std::cerr &lt;&lt; "the final value = " &lt;&lt; result &lt;&lt; std::endl);
</pre>

<p>Note that the macro is used as a statement and so must be terminated by a
semicolon outside of the closing parenthesis.</p>

<p>Prior to executing the statements, the macro prints the source file name and
line number, followed by the call stack depth and the function name (Gnu
compiler only - sorry, but VC++ does not provide a function name macro) without
a terminating newline, so ideally the print statement(s) should continue on the
same line. Thus you get a report like this:</p>

<pre class="terminal">
main.cpp:35: [23]main: the final value = 3
</pre>

<p>Thus shows that the debug report comes from file main.cpp line 35, the call
stack depth is 23 and the current function name is main.</p>

<pre class="cpp">
DEBUG_REPORT(str);
</pre>

<p>Statement Macro: takes a string (that is an STL string, not a char*) argument
which is printed out on standard error. It is similar to the IF_DEBUG macro. In
fact the equivalence is:

<pre class="cpp">
#define DEBUG_REPORT(str) IF_DEBUG(std::cerr &lt;&lt; str &lt;&lt; std::endl)
</pre>

<p>The string_utilities.hpp header can be very useful in creating string
representations of standard types to build up the string report. For example,
the above IF_DEBUG example could be rewritten:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
DEBUG_REPORT("the final value = " + to_string(result));
</pre>

<p>Note the use of the + operator for concatenation and the to_string() function
to give a string represenmtation of an integer. The output is the same as the
IF_DEBUG form:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
main.cpp:35: [23]main: the final value = 3
</pre>

<pre class="cpp">
DEBUG_ERROR(str);
</pre>

<p>Statement Macro: similar to DEBUG_REPORT except that it shouts out that an
error has occurred. Thus the line:</p>

<pre class="cpp">
DEBUG_ERROR("the final value = " + to_string(result));
</pre>

<p>The output now has the work ERROR tastefully inserted into the output:</p>

<pre class="terminal">
main.cpp:35: [23]main: ERROR: the final value = 3
</pre>

<pre class="cpp">
DEBUG_ON;
DEBUG_ON_LOCAL;
DEBUG_OFF;
</pre>

<p>These macros allow you to hard code debug reporting on regardless of the
state of the DEBUG environment variable. This is mainly used during development
to switch on debugging for the code currently under development. It is different
from normal debugging in that it only switches on debugging from the DEBUG_ON
macro to either the DEBUG_OFF or the return from the function. It does not
switch on debugging for functions called from that function. Thus is can be used
to concentrate on a small section of code without getting swamped with lower
level reports.</p>

<p>DEBUG_ON switches on recusive dubugging for the function the macro appears in
and all functions it calls, whilst DEBUG_ON_LOCAL switches on
debugging for the current function only and there is no recursion.</p>

<p>Once the code is working happily, if course these macros should be deleted
from the code.</p>
