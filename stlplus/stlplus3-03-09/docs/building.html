<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The STLplus library collection is intended to be portable between operating
systems and compilers. At present, this means Windows/Unix/MacOSX systems and
Gnu gcc/Microsoft/Borland compilers. Whether this will be extended to other
operating systems and compilers is a moot point, since the library requires a
good implementation of C++ templates.</p>

<p>In all cases you need to unpack the software into a directory which from
now on will be referred to as "the STLplus3 directory". This directory contains
a subdirectory for each of the libraries (e.g. "containers") and a subdirectory for the
documentation in "docs" and error messages in "messages".</p>

<p>The simplest approach is to simply build all of the libraries - using libraries stand-alone takes
a bit more work.</p>

<h2 id="dependencies">Dependencies</h2>

<p>As far as is reasonable, the STLplus libraries have been designed to be used separately. However,
some of the libraries use the STLplus containers and portability libraries to make them easier to
code and to make them portable too. Also, two of the libraries (persistence and strings) provide
additional functionality for the containers and portability libraries and therefore depend on them. 
The following table lists the dependencies:</p>

<table cellspacing="0">
<caption>Dependencies between STLplus libraries</caption>
<thead>
<tr><th scope="col">Library</th><th scope="col">Depends on</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>containers</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>persistence</td><td><i>containers</i>, <i>portability</i></td></tr>
<tr><td>portability</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>subsystems</td><td><b>containers</b>, <b>portability</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>strings</td><td><i>containers</i>, <i>portability</i></td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>The <b>bold</b> dependencies are required, or <b>hard</b> dependencies. If a library has a hard
dependency, then you cannot use it stand-alone - you must incorporate both the library and all of
its hard dependencies into your project.</p>

<p>The <i>italicised</i> dependencies are optional, or <i>soft</i> dependencies. They are on by
default, but can be switched off if the required library is not installed. For example, if you want
to use the persistence library as a stand-alone library for making C++ types persistent but are not
interested in the containers library, then that can be done.</p>

<p>The key to building a library without the soft dependency on the containers library is to build
using the following compiler directive:</p>

<dl>

<dt>-D NO_STLPLUS_CONTAINERS</dt>

<dd>Builds the library without the dependency on the containers library. All features provided by
the containers library will be disabled.</dd>

<dt>-D NO_STLPLUS_INF</dt>

<dd>Builds the library without the dependency on the portability/inf type which in turn removes the
dependency on the portability library. All features provided by the inf type will be disabled.</dd>

</dl>

<p>These compiler directives must be used to build the library - for example, to make the
portability library stand-alone, build it with these compiler directives. The same directives must
also be used to build any file in your program that includes headers from the library. The
simplest way to do this is to enable the directives for the whole project.</p>

<h2 id="monolithic">Monolithic Build</h2>

<p>You can merge the libraries together into one large library - known as a monolithic build of
STLplus. The simplest way of doing this is to use a shell - DOS shell on Windows, bash shell on
Linux or other Unix - and cd to the <code>stlplus3/source</code> directory. There, run the script
<code>make_monolithic</code>. This copies all of the source code into the directory. Then you will
find there are alternative project files and build scripts in the source directory to allow you to
use STLplus as a monolithic library.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the Monolithic build has the header
  file <code>stlplus3.hpp</code> which includes the whole library collection in
  one go.</p>

<p>The rest of the documentation is based on the assumption that you are using STLplus as a library
collection, but should be easy to relate to the us of the monolithic build instead.</p>

<h2 id="makefiles">Gnu Gcc Using My Makefiles</h2>

<h3>About my Make System</h3>

<p>If you are using Gnu gcc as your compiler, then I supply a set of make rules with
STLplus that will not only build this project but any other projects you are using too. In
each of the STLplus source directories is a <code>Makefile</code>. This is usually quite small. The
simplest <code>Makefile</code> contains the following:</p>

<pre class="script">
include ../../makefiles/gcc.mak
</pre>

<p>The <code>makefiles</code> module is required and can be downloaded from the same place that you
got the STLplus library. It contains the <code>gcc.mak</code> makefile rules which automatically
adjust to any project provided that it is organised in a certain way.</p>

<p>The STLplus Makefile assumes that the <code>makefiles</code> module is in the same parent
directory as the <code>stlplus3</code> module. This is recommended, but if you wish to
use a different configuration, you will need to edit the include path in the Makefile to reflect
the change.</p>

<p>At the top level of the STLplus library collection is another Makefile which will build
all of the libraries in one go. It contains the following:</p>

<pre class="script">
include ../../makefiles/subdirectories.mak
</pre>

<p>The <code>subdirectories.mak</code> rules simply call make recursively on each
subdirectory which contains a <code>Makefile</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>makefiles</code> module is a generic build system which provides a standard set of make
rules for compiling and linking virtually any libraries and applications. It is not specific to
STLplus. You are free to use it as the build system for your own projects if you prefer. It is
designed to be as simple as possible to use whilst allowing multi-library projects and different
build configurations - it currently supports a Debug build, a Release build and a Gprof (code
profiling) build. You do not have to use it of course - you can write your own Makefile. However,
you are recommended to use these makefiles to build STLplus.</p>

<h3>Building with my Make System</h3>

<p>To build the STLplus library collection, first start a command-line shell. Then change
directory to the STLplus3 directory. Then simply run one of the following
commands:</p>

<dl>

<dt>make</dt>
<dd>Builds a debug library</dd>

<dt>make RELEASE=on</dt>
<dd>Builds a release library</dd>

<dt>make GPROF=on</dt>
<dd>Builds a code profiling library (using gprof)</dd>

</dl>

<p>You can build all three of these variants of the library without them interfering since the
object files are stored in separate subdirectories for each build.</p>

<p>In all three cases the build creates an archive which is called lib&lt;library&gt;.a, where
&lt;library&gt; is the name of the library - e.g. libportability.a for the portability library. This
is stored in a subdirectory of the library directory which is build-specific. Refer to the <a
href="porting.html#progress">porting</a> page and look for the Build Name column in the table. As an example,
the build for DEC Alpha running Linux has the Build Name <code>LINUX-alpha</code>. This then has an extra
suffix added depending on the variant:</p>

<dl>
<dt>-debug</dt><dd>for the debug variant</dd>
<dt>-release</dt><dd>for the release variant</dd>
<dt>-gprof</dt><dd>for the gprof variant</dd>
</dl>

<p>So, for example, the debug variant of the DEC Alpha build will be stored in a subdirectory called
<code>LINUX-alpha-debug</code>.</p>

<p>When you use my makefile system in a multi-library project, the make system will automatically
select the correct version of <code>lib&lt;library&gt;.a</code> depending on the configuration
chosen for the build. For example, if you build an application dependent on the portability library
and you are on a DEC Alpha platform and building the debug variant, the build system will automatically
link with <code>LINUX-alpha-debug/libportability.a</code>.</p>

<h3>Using with my Make System</h3>

<p>Once you have built the STLplus library collection, you can incorporate any of its libraries into
another project. If you want, you can build your own projects with the <code>makefiles</code>
module. However, this is not necessary - see the section on <a href="#general">general
guidelines</a> - Using The Libraries.</p>

<p>To use the STLplus libraries as part of another project, you need to create a Makefile for
that project that will make the stlplus headers available and will link in the appropriate
archive files for each of the libraries that you are using. The recommended way of doing
this is to use the standard gcc.mak makefile provided as part of the makefiles module.</p>

<p>I'll assume that your project is in another directory next to (i.e. at the same level in the
filesystem) as the STLplus directory. I'll also assume you are using the makefiles module and that
this is also installed alongside. Finally, I'll assume that your source code is in a subdirectory of
the project directory, for example in a subdirectory called "source".</p>

<p>Here is an example Makefile to build an object library from source that includes the STLplus
portability and containers libraries:</p>

<pre class="script">
LIBRARIES = ../../stlplus3/portability ../../stlplus3/containers
include ../../makefiles/gcc.mak
</pre>

<p>This is stored in a file called Makefile in the source code directory of
the project.</p>

<p>The LIBRARIES variable is a space-separated list of libraries to include in
the project. It should point to the source code directory of each library, i.e. where the .hpp and
.cpp files are to be found.
The <code>makefiles</code> module's rules will build the current directory and
will add the LIBRARIES as extra include paths during compilation. Since this
Makefile only builds an object library, there is no link step.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> the LIBRARIES variable should list the libraries in their dependency order (see the <a
href="#dependencies">section on dependencies</a>) with the higher-level libraries first
and their required libraries after them. For example, the subsystems library should be listed before
the portability library.</p>

<p>When using this generic makefile, there are some rules to follow to make it
work.</p>

<ul>

<li>Project directories should have the same name as the library.</li>

<li>The project directory may have a subdirectory called source which contains all of the source
code plus the Makefile.</li>

<li>There should be no further sub-directories below the source directory.</li>

<li>All libraries in a project must have unique names.</li>

</ul>

<p>The current directory, i.e. the one containing the Makefile, may be called source, in which case
the directory above that is used as the name of the library. If the current directory is not called
source, then the directory name is taken to be the library name. For example, if you call your
project <code>test</code> and store the source in a folder <code>test/source</code> then the
makefile system will generate an object library called <code>libtest.a</code></p>

<p>To build a program rather than a library requires just one more line to be added to the Makefile.
Here is an example Makefile that builds a program:</p>

<pre class="script">
IMAGE     = client
LIBRARIES = ../../stlplus3/portability ../../stlplus3/containers
include ../../makefiles/gcc.mak
</pre>

<p>The IMAGE variable tells the make system first that a program is being built and second where the
linked program should be placed and what it should be called. In this case there is no path to the
IMAGE so it will be built in the current directory. The name of the program will be client (in fact,
on Windows, client.exe, but the .exe extension should never be specified).</p>

<p>A common variant is to link all programs into a common "bin" directory at
the same level of directory as the library directories. This is two levels up
from the source directory:</p>

<pre class="script">
IMAGE     = ../../bin/client
LIBRARIES = ../../stlplus3/portability ../../stlplus3/containers
include ../../makefiles/gcc.mak
</pre>

<p>The overall directory structure is now:</p>

<ul>
<li class="folder">&lt;parent directory&gt;
<ul>
<li class="folder">bin
<ul>
<li class="file">client.exe</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="folder">makefiles
<ul>
<li class="file">gcc.mak</li>
<li class="file">subdirectories.mak</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="folder">stlplus3
<ul>
<li class="folder">portability
<ul>
<li class="file">Makefile</li>
<li class="file">&lt;portability library source files&gt;</li>
<li class="folder">Linux-alpha-debug
<ul>
<li class="file">libportability.a</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="folder">containers
<ul>
<li class="file">Makefile</li>
<li class="file">&lt;containers library source files&gt;</li>
<li class="folder">Linux-alpha-debug
<ul>
<li class="file">libcontainers.a</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="folder">&lt;other stlplus3 libraries&gt;...
</li>
<li class="folder">docs</li>
<li class="folder">messages</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="folder">client
<ul>
<li class="folder">source
<ul>
<li class="file">Makefile</li>
<li class="file">&lt;client program source files&gt;</li>
<li class="folder">Linux-alpha-debug
<ul>
<li class="file">libclient.a</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>One final trick worth noting is that the IMAGE variable can be used to
put different operating system programs into different subdirectories by using the PLATFORM
variable. For example, here's a variant on the Makefile shown earlier for the client program:</p>

<pre class="script">
IMAGE     = ../../bin/${PLATFORM}/client
LIBRARIES = ../../stlplus3/portability ../../stlplus3/containers
include ../../makefiles/gcc.mak
</pre>

<p>This will put Cygwin binaries in ../../bin/CYGWIN and Linux binaries into ../../bin/LINUX.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the IMAGE variable can put each different build into a different subdirectory by
using the SUBDIR variable instead of PLATFORM. The SUBDIR variable includes a prefix for the
platform and the suffix for the different build configuration, so the debug build will be called
CYGWIN-i686-debug for the Cygwin build and LINUX-i686-debug for the Linux build.</p>

<h2 id="microsoft">Microsoft Visual Studio on Windows</h2>

<p>The STLplus library collection can alternatively be built on Windows using the native Microsoft
Visual Studio compiler. The STLplus library includes a Visual Studio workspace for Visual Studio 6 -
which can be converted automatically into a target file for Visual Studio 7
(.NET) or 8 (2005). It also includes a
solution file for Visual Studio 9 (2008). Furthermore, each library in the collection has its own
project file which can be incorporated into any other workspace or solution. So individual libraries
can be incorporated stand-alone in this way.</p>

<p>Beware that there is a terminology problem here - Microsoft call a library a project and a
project a workspace or solution, and so on. I will try to remember to use Microsoft terminology here.</p>

<h3>Building The Libraries</h3>

<p>The STLplus library collection comes with a Visual Studio 6 workspace file
(<code>stlplus3.dsw</code>) and a Visual Studio 9 solution file (<code>stlplus3.sln</code>) which
are kept in the top-level directory. You can open either by double-clicking it.</p>

<p>The workspace can now be built. This will build all of the libraries in the collection. First,
select the configuration you wish to build - Debug or Release. Then, for each project, make it the
current project by selecting menu item Project-&gt;Set&nbsp;Current&nbsp;Project. You can build all of
them one at a time or use the batch build. In Visual Studio 9 you can simply build the solution and
it builds all the projects.</p>

<p>The Debug configuration is for use in debug builds, the Release is for use in release builds (no
debug information). At this stage, if you wish, you can select other configurations and build them
too. Each configuration is stored separately so they do not overwrite each other.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> the supplied project file will build STLplus so that
it uses the multi-threaded DLL versions of the C runtime library (msvcrt.dll). 
The default when you create a new project in Visual Studio 6 however is to use
the single-threaded versions. You will need to adjust the project settings,
either for STLplus or for your application so that all projects use the same
settings. The symptom that will tell you that you have this problem is that,
when you link your application, every symbol in the C runtime library will
result in an error message from the linker saying that it is multiply
defined.</p>

<h3>Using The Libraries</h3>

<p>Once you have built the STLplus library collection, you can then use it in other
projects. This is done by loading the workspace or project file for your project (or create
a new one if you haven't done so yet). Then add the STLplus project files for those
libraries that you want to use in the new project.</p>

<p>You now need to set up an include path for the C++ compiler and a project dependency for
the linker.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> These instructions are for Visual Studio 6. Visual Studio 9 (2008) is similar but
all the dialogs have been redesigned - the principles however are the same.</p>

<p>To set up the include path, select the project that you wish to have access to the stlplus
libraries. Then select the menu item Project-&gt;Settings. A mind-bogglingly complicated dialog will
pop up. Select the configuration popup menu in the top left and choose All&nbsp;Configurations. Then
select the C++ tab from the set of tabs at the top of the right-hand pane. Then select the Category
popup menu just below the tabs and select Preprocessor. This has a text field called
Additional&nbsp;include&nbsp;directories. Type in the path to each of the subdirectories for each of
the STLplus libraries that you are using, separated by commas. You have to type this because
Microsoft didn't think to give you a directory selection dialog to help you here. However, you can
use relative paths such as <code>..\..\stlplus3\portability</code>. Click OK to
dismiss the mind-boggling dialog.</p>

<p>To set up the linker dependency, select the menu item Project-&gt;Dependencies. The
project you wish to set up dependencies for will be selected in the popup menu at the top
and the other projects, including the STLplus libraries, will be listed in the list entry
below that. Click on each of the STLplus libraries that you will be using so that a tick
appears. This makes the selected project depend on those libraries and therefore will cause
any program built with the selected project link with the stlplus archives. Click on OK to
dismiss the dependencies dialog.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> you should only set up a dependency on an application project, not on a project that
just creates a library. Sadly, Microsoft think a dependency on a library file should be resolved by
copying the contents of the library into the dependent library, giving you two copies of
the object code. This will subsequently cause a link error. The symptom is that the functions from
STLplus will be reported as multiply defined.</p>

<p>To test the configuration, try including an STLplus header in your code and calling a function
(or creating a class) from the library. You should be able to compile and link the project
successfully.</p>

<p>The most common error is to get the include path wrong or to forget to set the include path for
all configurations. This can be detected by the compiler giving an error on a #include line in your
code that includes the STLplus header. If this happens, redo the include path step above.</p>

<p>The second most common error is to simply forget to set up the linker dependency, since this does
not prevent compilation from working. This will manifest itself by a series of linker errors due to
missing symbols. If this happens, repeat the linker dependency step above.</p>

<p>The final common error is to have different projects with different run-time library selections.
This manifests itself by linker errors whereby standard library functions are multiply defined in
different libraries. To fix this, select the menu item Project-&gt;Settings and select a specific
Configuration (you cannot do this for All&nbsp;Configurations. For example, select the Debug
configuration. Then select the C++ tab at the top right and then select the popup menu immediately
below the tag, choosing the Code&nbsp;Generation option. There are four popup menus here and the top
right of them is labelled Use&nbsp;Run-time&nbsp;Library. This should be the same for all projects -
check this by clicking on different projects in the left hand pane whilst watching the contents of
the run-time library popup. If there are inconsistencies, correct them. For a debug build, always
pick a debug library, but you can then choose whether it is a single-threaded static library, a
multi-threaded static library or a multi-threaded DLL. Choose the same for all projects. Then change
the configuration to Release and check them too. This time, choose the non-debug versions of the
run-time library. When you are happy that you have consistency, click OK to dismiss the dialog and
try building again.</p>

<p>In the default project file supplied with STLplus, the Debug configuration links with the Debug
Multi-Threaded DLL and the Release configuration links with the Multi-Threaded DLL. You can either
adopt the same conventions or change your copy of the stlplus project file.</p>

<h2 id="general">General Guidelines for Building STLplus</h2>

<p>The last two sections described the simplest case of building the whole collection with my
supplied build files. This section explains how the libraries are built so you can incorporate it
into your own build system should you choose to. If you are happy with my build system, then there
is no need to read any more of this document.</p>

<h3>Building The Libraries</h3>

<p>The first and most important thing that you need to know about STLplus is that it is just source
code. There is no magic to it - all you need to do is to compile the .cpp files for each library
with a compiler that is up to the job and the library is ready to use.</p>

<p>Then, once all of the library collection is built, you can include any of the headers by putting
the library directories in your compiler's include path.</p>

<p>Similarly, when you link your application (or library), make sure the object files created from
compiling STLplus are linked into your application.</p>

<p>To make life easier, bundle the compiled object files for each library into an archive (using the
'ar' command on Unix for example). Then you only have to make sure the archive is linked into your
application. You could even bundle together all the object files for all the libraries in the
collection to make a single big archive.</p>

<p>You can even drop all the source files into one directory and compile them all into a monolithic
library - it will work just the same.</p>

<p>That is all. There really is nothing to it. The reason I keep on about this ease of use is that
I've had nightmare scenes with other code libraries which require mind-bogglingly complicated
procedures to build and use them which tend to fail on unconventional systems such as the Cygwin
Unix-emulator on Windows which I use a lot. So I want to let you know
that STLplus is not like this - it is trivially easy to build.</p>

<p>The STLplus library collecion is designed to be built in either debug or release
variants. If you use the make utilities provided, these are set up with the
two variants already. However, if you want to do it yourself, here are
examples of the options to use. The examples are for the Gnu gcc compiler, but
the same principles can be applied to any other compiler.</p>

<pre class="script">
release build: gcc -I. -D&lt;platform&gt; -funsigned-char -DNDEBUG -O3 -c &lt;source file&gt; -o &lt;object file&gt;
debug build:   gcc -I. -D&lt;platform&gt; -funsigned-char -g           -c &lt;source file&gt; -o &lt;object file&gt;
</pre>

<p>In this description, the following are specific to the recommended way of
building STLplus:</p>

<dl>

<dt>-D&lt;platform&gt;</dt>

<dd>The name of the platform (i.e. operating system) that you are building on. The word
&lt;platform&gt; should be replaced by the actual platform, e.g. -DLINUX or -DCYGWIN. This defines a
macro which is then used within the code as a compiler directive to control platform-specific
features. If this is missing then you get a generic Unix build - which will be correct for any
Posix-compliant variant of Unix. A native Windows build should define _WIN32 (Note: the Visual
Studio compiler and the Borland compiler do this for you, as does the Gnu gcc compiler when run in
Windows native mode). The required values for these directives are listed on the page
on <a href="porting.html#progress">porting</a> in the column labelled <code>-D</code>.</dd>

<dt>-funsigned-char</dt>

<dd>
There is an ambiguity in C++ and C in that type <code>char</code> can be either
<code>unsigned</code> or <code>signed</code> and this is compiler and platform
dependent. This has caused problems in the past, so I have decided to force the
signedness of <code>char</code> to <code>unsigned</code> for all platforms.
</dd>

<dt>-DNDEBUG</dt>

<dd>In release builds, this removes debug code such as assertions, making the
code faster and smaller. It is the switch used by the ANSI C standard for the
assert() macro but is also used for the STLplus debug code.</dd>

<dt>-O3</dt>

<dd>In release builds, switch compiler optimisations on to get small, fast
code. In debug mode, optimisations should be switched off so the program has
all the original code present and can be stepped through in a debugger.</dd>

<dt>-g</dt>

<dd>In debug builds, the -g option includes symbolic information so that the
program can be run in a debugger. In release mode, omit this switch to make
the code harder to reverse engineer as well as a lot smaller and faster.</dd>

</dl>

<p>Again let me reiterate that these compiler switches are specific to the gcc
compiler used in this example. However, the <em>principles</em> explained here
should be used to build the library for any compiler. You just need to find
the correct compiler switches that will achieve these principles for your
compiler of choice.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> if you are building an application in <em>debug</em> mode, you should link with
<em>debug</em> builds of the libraries. Similarly, if you are building an application in
<em>release</em> mode, you should link with <em>release</em> builds of the libraries. This is because
both the application and STLplus itself include the STLplus headers and there can be subtle
differences in implementation between release and debug builds.</p>

<h3>Platform Directives</h3>

<p>As stated above, different platforms are identified by the -D directive so that differences
between operating systems can be handled. The following table shows the different platform values
currently used and which ones are actually used to make a difference.</p>

<p>Where it says "yes" in the Used column, the directive must be provided to build correctly. Where
it says "no", there is no need to provide the directive and you will get a Posix-compliant build.</p>

<h3>Using The Libraries</h3>

<p>To use the STLplus libraries for compilation, simply make sure that the directory containing the
STLplus source files for each of the libraries you are using are in your include path. For example
the following would include the containers and portability libraries:</p>

<pre class="script">
gcc -I$STLPLUS3/containers  -I$STLPLUS3/portability ...
</pre>

<p>This assumes that the environment variable STLPLUS3 points to the STLplus directory. You
will have to define the variable with the correct path if you want to do it this way.
Alternatively, just give the full path in the -I option.</p>

<p>For linking, you need to simply include the lib&lt;library&gt;.a archives in the
link. For a debug build of your program, link with the debug build of the
STLplus library. For a release build, link with the release build of STLplus.
For example:</p>

<pre class="script">
ld ... $STLPLUS3/portability/&lt;target_dir&gt;/libportability.a $STLPLUS3/containers/&lt;target_dir&gt;/libcontainers.a ...
</pre>

<p>In this case, &lt;target_dir&gt; will be something like <code>LINUX-alpha-debug</code> for a
debug build and <code>LINUX-alpha-release</code> for a release build.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> when linking, you should list the libraries in their dependency order (see the <a
href="#dependencies">section on dependencies</a>) with the higher-level libraries first
and their required libraries after them. For example, the subsystems library should be listed before
the portability library.</p>

<h2 id="cygwin">Unix-emulation build on Windows using Cygwin and Gnu gcc</h2>

<p>You can build Unix command-line tools and libraries on Windows using the Gnu gcc compiler if you
first install the <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a> system. This system is a
Unix-emulation layer which provides a Unix-like systems interface to the Windows operating system.
For example, you access the file system as if it was a Unix file-system, create subprocesses using
the Unix functions fork and exec, create pipes using Unix pipe and so on. This is a great way of
porting Unix utilities to Windows, but has the disadvantage that you have to use Unix-like paths
instead of Windows-like paths. I use Cygwin to develop the Unix version of STLplus whilst actually
sitting at a Windows-based PC. For a native Windows version, see the next section.</p>

<p>You need to install Cygwin before you can build the Cygwin version of the STLplus library. Then
simply follow the instructions for building STLplus with Gnu tools.</p>

<h2 id="cygming">Native build on Windows using Cygwin and Gnu gcc</h2>

<p>The Cygwin development environment introduced in the last section also allows <em>native</em>
Windows applications to be built using the Gnu compiler. Unlike Unix-emulation builds, this does not
use the Unix emulation layer and you therefore access operating services through the Windows system
calls directly. This kind of build is known as a CygMing build.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> version 3.2 and later of gcc works very well in this mode. Prior
versions were incomplete and I don't support them. Version 4 no longer
supports this mode as far as I can tell, so use the MinGW compiler instead.</p>

<p>You build native applications with the Cygwin gcc compiler by specifying a
special compiler switch (-mno-cygwin) for both compilation and linking. </p>

<p>The compiler is pre-configured with _WIN32 enabled when used in CygMing mode, so programs and
libraries (such as STLplus) that use this switch will automatically build correctly.</p>

<p>The following settings are used
in addition to the standard rules for the Cygwin builds:</p>

<pre class="script">
compile   : same as Cygwin plus: -mno-cygwin
link      : same as Cygwin plus: -mno-cygwin
</pre>

<p>The standard Makefile system I supply can be switched into native compilation mode when compiling
on Cygwin (and only then) by setting the environment variable CYGMING to the value "on". This name
is a reflection of the fact that the ability to compile native Windows applications comes from a
combination of the Cygwin project and the Mingw project (Mingw standas for "minimum Gnu on
Windows"). The CYGMING variable can be set in the command line to make:</p>

<pre class="script">
make CYGMING=on
</pre>

<p>This is a one-off setting. To make the setting more permanent, change the
environment of the shell you're running:</p>

<pre class="script">
export CYGMING=on
make
</pre>

<h2 id="mingw">Native build on Windows using MinGW Gnu gcc</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://www.mingw.org/">MinGW</a> development environment also allows <em>native</em>
Windows applications to be built using the Gnu compiler. This accesses operating services through
the Windows system calls directly. It is also simpler to install and use than Cygwin.</p>

<p>The compiler is pre-configured with _WIN32 enabled, so programs and libraries (such as STLplus)
that use this switch will automatically build correctly.</p>

<p>The standard Makefile system I supply will compile out of the box with MinGW if it is run in the MSys
environment.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong>The makefile system will mis-identify the compiler as a Cygwin build if you run the
MinGW compilers in the Cygwin shell, but it will in fact build correctly as a MinGW build.</p>

<h2 id="unix-other">Other Unix builds using Gnu gcc</h2>

<p>STLplus is designed to be portable to any Unix system, well at least any Posix-compliant Unix
system, but this is only true when using the Gnu gcc compiler. Native compilers on the various
flavours of Unix are not supported. This is not a realistic goal when there are so many variations
between compilers.</p>

<p>The only problem you may have is that your version of Unix is not recognised by the makefiles
module. You can test this by running make and seeing if you get an error message.</p>

<p>If you do get an error, you can easily add support for your platform. The key is the first
executable code in the makefiles/gcc.mak file:</p>

<pre class="script">
OS     := $(shell uname -s)

ifneq ($(findstring CYGWIN,$(OS)),)
...
</pre>

<p>This executes the 'uname' system command and then tries to identify the operating system by
recognising a substring of the return value. This is then used to set PLATFORM to a simplified name
for that platform. For example, the current version of Cygwin that I'm using has a uname of
"CYGWIN_NT-5.0". The code shown above recognises the Cygwin build and sets PLATFORM to be the
simplified form "CYGWIN". In general, the PLATFORM value should be a short representation of the
operating system name in uppercase and with no punctuation since it is passed to the compiler as a
macro. Different names should be used for different versions of the operating system that use
different object code and are not binary compatible. Binary compatible versions of an operating
system should be mapped onto the same short name. Thus, support for all Linux systems can be handled
by one variant:</p>

<pre class="script">
# Build on Linux
ifneq ($(findstring Linux,$(UNAME)),)
PLATFORM  := LINUX
endif
</pre>

<p>In fact, support for Linux and Solaris has already been added in this way. Further platforms will
be added as I try them.</p>

<p>The PLATFORM name is used as the prefix to the subdirectory used to store object code. Thus the
Cygwin debug build is stored in CYGWIN-i686-debug whilst the Linux debug build is stored in
LINUX-i686-debug. This organisation means that the same disk can be mounted on different operating
systems and built without the different operating systems conflicting with each other. It also keeps
the different kinds of build (e.g. release or debug) in separate directories.</p>

<p>The PLATFORM value is also passed to the compiler as a macro definition in the form
-D&lt;platform&gt;, where &lt;platform&gt; is the name of the platform (e.g. -DLINUX). This means
that if it proves necessary to differentiate between platforms to get any part of the C++ code
working, then this is done by adding "#ifdef LINUX" or whatever compiler switches to the code. The
macro _WIN32 is defined for native Windows builds regardless of the compiler - if this is not set
then the default is to assume a vanilla Unix build. To date, only very minor differences have been
found between different Unix platforms. However, if you use a different build system it is a good
idea to pass this parameter to the compiler (e.g. -DLINUX) in case future updates to the library do
need to have these switches. Check the ../../makefiles/gcc.mak file for the values currently
supported, even if you don't plan to use my make system.</p>
